Holy cow!
        Over 155 different people visited redune.com yesterday. That's just amazing. Won't be long till I'll be getting 1000 of you every day eh?
        Must be my new <a href="http://www.smoothwall.org">Smoothwall</a> firewall
        that I am running (Finally found a use for my old Compaq). The harder my site is to
        hack, the more nerds will try and visit it. Plus if you may have noticed, when you
        type in redune.com you no longer get sent to www2.redune.com:7042. For some reason,
        either Sympatico deciding to play nice, or my Smoothwall, port 80 is no longer blocked.
        So redune.com is truly at redune.com now. Horray!<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=475" />
