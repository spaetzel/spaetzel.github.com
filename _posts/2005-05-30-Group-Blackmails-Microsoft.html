        for Xbox Freedom</a>
        <br />
        In pretty crazy news, a Xbox "research group" says that they have figured out a way
        to run Linux on the Xbox without any modchip or other hacks. They have blackmailed
        Microsoft, if MSFT doesn't release an official Xbox version of Linux, they'll release
        their pirate version--essentially eliminating all copyright protection on the Xbox.

        It will be intersting to see what happens here.<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=267" />
