So I spent the whole day working on my computers. I have moved my big hard drive from my desktop to the server. So now I have a nice central media server. But in the process of moving, I managed to mess up the boot loader of the desktop and was forced to reinstall Windows. I was planning on doing the reinstall in the near future, but just not right now.<br />

        Anyhow, all of the photos are now all on the Linux Server (aka Hyperion) so I should
        be getting the rest of the galleries up soon, its just that it takes soooo long to
        import each one since it is a pitiful 400Mhz Celeron. Ah well, it does the job well
        otherwide.<br />

        Pete has invited me to a Music "Jamming" party. Probably will go, we'll see if I enjoy
        it though...<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=134" />
