So we had a very quick and very wet Thunderstorm here this afternoon. I got the tripod and everything all set up hoping to get some good lightning shots, but it was so quick that it never got dark enough for some good ones. <br />

        Here is a great photo of the clouds around the sun soon after the storm ended. It
        didn't look very good on the LCD, but on the computer I was amazed. <img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=151" />
