        Well I'm sitting here in the computer lab in Physics coding away at my 307 assignment.
        Going really well. Just a couple bugs to work out. I'll have this thing done, bonuses
        and all in no time!<br />
        I'm wishing that I had packed myself a snack though, supper with LL tonight is looking
        rather atttractive. 45 Minutes until band practice, then supper... Mmm<br />
        <br />
        Going to be studying it up with LL tonight. She's really a good inspiration to keep
        me focused on my annoying logic problems instead of making tiny changes to my website
        all of the time... Wait a second, what am I doing now?<br />
        <br />
        Back to work!<br />
