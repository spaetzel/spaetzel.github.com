So, I just set up the internet in my new Waterloo apartment. Thus redune.com will be up again for the rest of the day.<br />
        I'll be taking it down again tommorow due to the fact that my room is being painted.<br />
        <br />
        The move went well. Had fun with LL getting everything packed up. Things were a little
        behind schedule, and it was lot of work, but it was very successful.<br />
        <br />
        Take a look at the pictures from the whole move.<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=94" />
