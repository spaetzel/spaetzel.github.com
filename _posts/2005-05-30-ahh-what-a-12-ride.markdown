So I just got back from an excellent 1/2 of a bike ride. Why 1/2 of a ride do you say? I'll tell you.<br />
        <br />
        So I first rode from my Apartement to Maplesoft (Takes 20 minutes, I'll be doing it
        again as often as possible). Then I headed up Northfield to Laurel Creek Conservation
        area, just as I was pulling into the Park I got a flat :-( No bother though, I had
        a spare tube with me. So, 5 minutes later, I'm back on the road.<br />
        <br />
        I went flying though the trails in there, so much fun. A little muddy still, but I
        like it that way. I came up to Columbia lake and decided that I would ride around
        it, turns out that the direction I chose requires you to go on the road.
        <br />
        But as soon as I get onto the road my back wheel starts to feel funny. I look down,
        another flat!<br />
        <br />
        This is a big deal, I don't have any more tubes with me. So I try and Mcguiver myself
        a nice patch. As I'm doing this a helpful woman bikes by and asks if I need help,
        I ask if she has a patch, nope. But she does have a cell phone. So I call up Pete,
        no answer! I tell her I'll be ok, I can walk home. But she was concerned and said
        that she lives just nearby and she'll send her husband with her car. I am so thankful
        for them. On the way to my place her husband and I talked about all the trails in
        Waterloo, turns out we're surrounded with them. And he's been to Maplesoft too, he
        works for Bell and helped set things up in the new place.<br />
        <br />
        Anyways, two super helpful strangers saved my day. Thanks so much Nela and Steve!<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=116" />
