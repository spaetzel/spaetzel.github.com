Here are photos of the last tourist trap that we visited, the <a href="http://railwaymuseum.ab.ca/">Albera
        Railway Museum</a>.
        <br />
        You know things are a touch wrong when you are heaed to a museum and the road turns
        to rough gravel.<br />
        The best way to describe the museum is "Where old trains go to die"<br />
        I can see the appeal to train buffs perhaps, but the place is so poorly maintained,
        basically it is just a bunch of trains in a a field that you can walk though. Everything
        is a mess, there are very few descriptions of the trains, and some spots just didn't
        even look too safe.<br />
        Still managed many nice photos of trains though <img alt=":-)" src="smilies/happy.gif"><img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=67" />
