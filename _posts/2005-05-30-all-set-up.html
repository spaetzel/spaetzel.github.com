So it looks as though the copying is complete.<br />
        I've got all the functionality (still missing pictures) copied over to the new server.<br />
        <br />
        Hopefully will get the photo galleries up by tonight.<br />
        <br />
        Oh yea. This new switch means that the server will defintely be up 24/7 once I move
        it into its final location.<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=130" />
