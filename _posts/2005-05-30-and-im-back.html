I had an absolutely wonderful time with Laura-Lee this weekend. Even if most of it was spent driving.<br />
        The trip to Sudbury wasn't too bad. Though there were a few events that kept it from
        being perfect. First off, boarding the bus in Toronto, I was told that the bus does
        not go to Laurentian University like the Greyhound website says it does. "No point
        in going there in the summer" the driver told me. Maybe there's a point if someone
        has made plans to meet someone there!
        <br />
        <!--more-->
        <br />
        But he assured me that he can let me off at a corner which is a quick walk away from
        the University. Let me say... It wasn't quite close. More like a 1/2 hour walk, which
        isn't fun at 11 PM when you are carrying a suitcase and in huge desire to see the
        girl you love. I tried making use of Roger's much touted #TAXI. It doesn't work at
        all. The stupid thing used voice recognition, and I couldn't for the best of me get
        it to call a taxi from Sudbury. So I used 411 instead. Somehow the Operator there
        decided that Sudbury and North Bay are the same place!<br />
        <br />
        Well it was wonderful once I saw her. We had so much fun hanging out. Especially had
        a wonderful breakfast at the restaurant beneath the Sudbury Travellodge. So much great
        food.
        <br />
        <br />
        After Breakfast/Lunch (Brunch?) LL had to go write her exam. So we drove over there
        and dropped her off. I then went to Lake Laurentian Conservation Area. That place
        is gorgeous. And it is semi-closed during weekends so it was very quiet in there.
        On top of the beautiful sights (Of which the pictures will soon be uploaded) I also
        discovered that wild blueberries are now ripe. So I picked a whole lot of those. Yum!<br />
        <br />
        After LL's exam we headed to Val D'Or, Quebec, where her Grandparents were to be found.
        That was the best 6 hours I have ever spent in a car. Time goes by to much faster
        when my sweetheart is in the car with me! Even waiting 40 minutes for an accident
        was no problem at all.
        <br />
        <br />
        We arrived in Val D'Or at about 11:00 and we spent a quick time doing brief introductions
        to her family. And then it was time for bed. We started off the morning with a huge
        breakfast where I ended up eating 5 pieces of French Toast. Then LL's Papa took me
        down into the mine in Val D'Or. That was so much fun. It is amazing going though that
        place with a Man who had spent 40 years working there. He knows so much about it and
        is so proud of what he has done. I learnt so much there, and definitely far better
        than the others who were stuck with a teenage tour guide.<br />
        <br />
        After the mine LL and I spent some time hanging out with her little cousins. They
        are really a blast. The oldest (5 years old) is so full of energy. She just keeps
        on talking and talking, none of which I understand because she is going on in French
        the whole time. But LL seems to know enough to keep her happy.
        <br />
        <br />
        Then at 2:00 it was time to head over to St. Hubert's where we were having lunch.
        Pretty much every one there had ribs in one sort of another. The food was excellent.
        Especially my Chocolate Dream cake, big Yum! Of course that was fun too, I got to
        speak with LL's family, and also to take in their general family talk. They did an
        excellent job of making me feel at home there. It was great!<br />
        <br />
        Afterwards it was time for the Annual family pictures. This was a very big event,
        which turns out to be very difficult getting all 10 of the people there all arranged.
        Especially the very little ones who really just want to pick the pretty flowers. But
        I think the photos turned out well and as I said before, I'll be posting many of them.<br />
        <br />
        Finally, after the pictures. LL and I started the 4 hour trek to Timmins. Which also
        didn't seem very long at all. Not only did I have a great time talking with LL, but
        the roads are gorgeous up there. So twisty and wooded. Lots of fun. The worst part
        though, was the 50 minutes where you are within "Timmins" that city is so big that
        you have to drive a really long ways before you are actually there. The whole time
        wishing so much to be there already.<br />
        <br />
        In Timmins, LL surprised me with a "Summer Birthday" where she got me all sorts of
        great summer gifts, that was so much of a surprise. Love really loved it! I think
        I did a good job of thanking her for it, but here I go again, Thanks LL!<br />
        <br />
        And of course today, the dreaded day where I had to go home. The visit was far too
        short. Every time I see LL, I miss her a little more. I really can't wait to see her
        again, and am looking forward to having a nice long phone conversation with her tommorow
        night!<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=162" />
