Today at MSW was easier to take. The talks made much more sense to me since they were less theoretical. Also it was much nicer that we were done our responsibilites at 2:30. So it gave Soo and I opportunity to make up for yesterday's late night. So we went uptown to an art store where she got some (take a guess) art supplies (who'd think?)<br />

        Got to hang out with my friend Mark from PE for a bit this afternoon. He was down
        for two days. I'm very glad I got off early, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to
        see him.<br />
        <br />
        Anyhow, here is another photo that I took of the BAB at Laurer. This time up on the
        4th floor.
        <br />
        I'm very impressed.<br />
