Hello all,<br />
        <br />
        The product that I have been working on at <a href="http://www.maplesoft.com">Maplesoft</a> for
        the last few week has just been launched. It is the Calculus Study Guide. This is
        an interactive eBook that uses Maple to help students though their first year courses
        in Calculus.<br />
        <br />
        I was responsible for formatting the worksheets, proofreading them, creating all of
        the marketing material, and QA testing the product. Basically, I did everything except
        write the base content.<br />
        <br />
        You can check out the product at:<br />

        <br />
        <br />
        While you're at it, go ahead and buy it...<br />
        <br />
        I'm proud of this accomplishment, and hope that I'll keep on getting jobs of this
        magnitude or larger.<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=191" />
