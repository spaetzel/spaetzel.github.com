        Well since I wasn't able to bring my camera with me today, I decide to put up photo
        I took from my archives, call it an Archive Picture Of The Day. I took this one in
        Banff, Alberta. Had to climb a long long path to get there, and this was the only
        nice view there was. Rather beautiful though, I love how the clouds colour the mountain
        off in the distance.<br />
