Well, I've definitely taken a great hiatus from posting. I've been so busy and enjoying myself so much that I haven't been bothering to post. Not so good to all of my fans, but great for me. Time for a bit of an update then I guess. <br />
        <br />
        I've spent the last few weekends with LL. It is so great being able to see her so
        often, definitely a great inprovement over the once and a while visit in Timmins.
        Plus a $24 1.5 hr bus ride is nothing. Its so great.<br />
        <br />
        I've been having a pretty good time at work. I've been very busy working away developing
        a product for a Prof at York University, it is pretty cool working at this job, sometimes
        it is awfully difficult to understand what other people want though. However that
        is definitely a common problem in life, and I am learning a lot from the experience.<br />
        <br />
        I bought the original Star Wars trilogy of DVD on Tuesday, definitely an excellent
        purchase and I highly reccomend that anyone who likes the movies invest in them. Though
        they are Lucas' modified versions, I don't mind to much, they are still great movies.
        Just as long as I can't find Jar Jar in them.<br />
        <br />
        I may finally get back into doing POTDs. I have finished rotating all of the Europe
        photos and the gallery should be complete soon. I'll let you know as soon as I do.<br />
        <br />
        Alright, I promise to keep you more informed in the future. But I still place no guarantees....<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=176" />
