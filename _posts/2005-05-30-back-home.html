All good things must come to an end,<br />
        Over 1000 photos later, it was time to head back to Ontario.<br />
        So here are photos of the plane flight back to the <a href="http://www.londonairport.on.ca/">London
        Airport</a>. Had a great flight, thanks <a href="http://www.westjet.com/">Westjet</a>
        <br />
        Even managed to get a photo of the way into <a href="http://www.sunsets.com/portelgin/">Port
        Elgin</a>. Its amazing that I managed to fit so many great photos onto a tiny 256MB
        CompactFlash card.<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=68" />
