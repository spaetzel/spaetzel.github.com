Rock and Trees and trees and rocks and rocks and trees and trees and rocks and .... Water!!!<br />

        Long long long long bus ride back to Waterloo. Defintely decided that the best way
        to travel is Unconsious. Even though the trip was 4 hours shorter than to Timmins
        it sure seemed a lot longer.<br />
        <br />
        A well at least I had lots of recent memories to think about. (And a lot of food too,
        thanks LL's mom)<br />
        <br />
        Just a couple pics of my last bus today. Didn't get a chance to take a pic of bus
        #3, In Timmins I was otherwise occupied, and in Toronto I had to run to get my next
        bus, which I missed anyways.<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=112" />
