        I really don't like writing essays!<br />
        Although I am finding reading about <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org">Extreme
        programming</a> intersting. I'm just not a fan of huge three thousand word essays.<br />
        Ah well, it'll be over on Sunday.<br />
        <br />
        I filled out a bunch of internship applications today.<br />
        Two for Honeywell, Five more for IBM and one for Bruce Power.<br />
        <br />
        Honeywell even wants someone with C# experience - Glad to have picked that up, will
        give me a bit of an advantage!<br />
