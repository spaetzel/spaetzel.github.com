I went shopping at <a href="http://www.whiteoaksmall.on.ca/home.shtml">White Oaks
        Mall</a> yesterday with LL, had a blast. She tried on so many different clothes (all
        of which she looked great in). I even got myself a shirt from <a href="http://www.eddiebauer.com/eb/default.asp">Eddie
        Bauer</a>, that will be perfect to wear to work.<br />
        <br />
        There were a lot of flowers blooming in front of the entrance to the mall, here is
        my favorite photo that I took of them:<br />
