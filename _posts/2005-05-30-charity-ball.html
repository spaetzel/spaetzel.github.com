        Well I had a blast last night at the charity ball. There was lots and lots of standing
        in line, but when you shove that many people all into a room these things are going
        to happen. Just need to have some patience.<br />
        I casn see that the USC really put a lot of work into the event, and I'm glad that
        my money has gone off to a couple good causes (The London Humane Society, and the
        Alhzeimer's society)<br />
