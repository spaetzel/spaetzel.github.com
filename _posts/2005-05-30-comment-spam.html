Well it looks like the thing that I've been safe from for a while has finally hit.<br />
        <br />
        I'm getting a lot of comment spam. If you take a look at any of the below entries,
        they all have a comment by "Texas holdem". He is just trying to get Google to see
        all of the links back to his website so that his website will rise in the search rankings.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm going to have to implement something to stop that. Blarg!<br />
        <br />
        Update:<br />
        Well, I just installed the <a href="http://sm.farook.org/index.php?p=149">WPBlacklist</a> plugin
        and I was able to delete tons of spam comments. Over 500 of them! I had no idea the
        problem had gotten so bad. Hopefully the plugin will be able to stop them from posting
        any new comments as well. If anybody finds any spam getting through the cracks, please
        let me know!<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=223" />
