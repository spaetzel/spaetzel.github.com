        Well my Photography book did a big part of what I hoped it would do. Inspired me to
        go out and take photos. So I went out on a Photo walk and came back with a full memory
        card.<br />
        <br />
        I saw so much on the walk, Amazing Flowers, Cool Insects, Cute Rabbits, and a Beautiful
        Sunset (any my Aunt Nancy).<br />
        <br />
        Take a look at the whole gallery, it is full of great photos. And here is the best
        photo of them all. An awesome macro shot of a wasp in a flower.<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=149" />
