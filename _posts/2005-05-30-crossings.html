I see these Ducks almost every day. Today they were so close and cute that I had to take another photo of them. Unfortunately a Van drove out of the parking lot as I was taking the pictures and scared them away. But I still managed to get a few nice pics.<br />
        <br />
        I did a lot of editing on this one too. Take a look at the edited version:<br />

        And then look at the <a href="../Photos/2004_05_18 - Nice Chicks Part 2/139_3932.JPG">original
        version.</a><img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=107" />
