        Great news, It looks like the Shuttles may start to fly sooner than expected. May
        help the US to beat the EU's <a href="http://news.com.au/common/printpage/0,6093,6651905,00.html"> mission
        to Mercury</a>

        I'm just waiting for someone to claim the <a href="http://www.xprize.org/">Xprize</a> so
