So the <a href="/spaetzel/index.php?p=412">thing</a> has been charging for at least
        30 hours, and its supposed to be ready in 8... Methinks there is something wrong with
        it. I was so excited to get this thing, and now I'm going to have to wait for a replacement.
        Dammit!<br />
        But I hear that they replace these watches with the latest model. So I'd be going
        from a watch that I paid ten bucks for to one that is still selling for $150... that
        wouldn't be a bad deal... We'll have to see what happens.<br />
        <br />
        Still I'm annoyed, it means I'll proabaly have to be dealing with this still while
        LL is here. Grr<br />
