So,<br />
        <br />
        I've told you part of how much I want the Nikon D70. Such a nice camera.
        <br />
        However, it is $2000 for a camera. That does nothing but take pictures. Very nice
        pictures, but still just pictures.<br />
        <br />
        Maybe I'll get one later when I have money coming out of my ears. Until then my Canon
        will more than get me by. Plus it is a whole lot less to worry about during the Europe
        trip.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'll still dream of the D70 though.<br />
        <br />
        I'm going to go do the dishes and then go for another photo walk. Will post the pics
        when I get back of course!<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=153" />
