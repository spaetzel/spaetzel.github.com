        Are you interested in seeing a bunch of the people that I lived with in my first year
        at Western? This photo was taken at the Essex formal in 2002. I have tagged everyone's
        face so you can know who they are.

        I have uploaded all of the photos I had on my hard drive from 2 South. They all have
        this tag <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/redune/tags/2south/">2 south</a>. Most
        of the photos have been tagged friends only so you have to sign up for Flickr and
        log in to see them.

        If you are not one of my Flickr friends, leave a comment and I'll fix that.
