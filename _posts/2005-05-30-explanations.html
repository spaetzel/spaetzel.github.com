So.<br />
        I've been really slacking off on the posts. Not quite sure why.
        <br />
        I blame it on the pending upgrade. I'd like to set the site up on a dedicated server.
        But I am currently waiting for the server to become available.<br />
        <br />
        Hopefully I'll get back on it then.<br />

        Also, at the moment pictures don't work because I upgraded Wordpress which boggled
        the old photo plugin. So I've got to get around to reinstalling that...<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=120" />
