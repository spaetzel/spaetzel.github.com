        Aww, memories!<br />

        I came across this photo which was taken in Fergus, Ontario. That was a really pretty
        town. Not quite as nice as Elora (where I attended grades 1 to 6). But still very
        nice.<br />
        <br />
        I've gotta check Flickr to see if I can find some Elora photos.
