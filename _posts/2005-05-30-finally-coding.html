As you can see below, I actually have been spending some time doing development on my own time. This is a great feeling. I am actually working on the new website that I've been dreaming about for a couple of months now.  Maybe it will be something really big, maybe it won't. I sure want to get it working. For a teaser check out <a href="http://epic.chalksidewalk.com/">EPIC</a>.<br />
        <br />
        I'm making good progress at the small first steps. I've got a lot of work ahead of
        me before something useful comes out of this, so we'll see what happens.
