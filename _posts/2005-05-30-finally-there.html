Now that was  a looong trip.<br />
        Fortunately I spent most of the time asleap. At least between piddly little towns.
        The bus stopped at a small town about every 1/2 hour of course waking me up.
        <br />
        The last 4 hours of that trip were soooo long though, I wasn't tired anymore so I
        couldn't sleep, and I was almost there! I couldn't wait to see LL.<br />
        It was so great to se her, missed her a lot. Lots of big squishes were exchanged.
        <br />
        We spent the day hanging around in Timmins, took a walk around a lake (What's it called
        again Sweetie?), had a hot chocolate at Timmy's, watched a movie, All of it was great.<br />
        <br />
