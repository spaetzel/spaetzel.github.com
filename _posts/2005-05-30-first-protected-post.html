        Well I guess that since I now have my high security system in place, I can now blather
        on about anything that bothers me. Sounds good to me.<br />
        <br />
        I miss my sweetheart so much, she is always on my mind and I can't wait until friday
        when I finally get to give her a big hug again. That will be so great! Sadly the weekend
        won't have much time for just the two of us, since we'll be going with the Marching
        band to play at the football game at Queens on Saturday, 10 hours on a bus! And then
        on Sunday, I'm sure she needs to get a lot of work done.<br />
        But it all doesn't matter what we are doing, I will be so happy just as long as I'm
        with her! <img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=181" />
