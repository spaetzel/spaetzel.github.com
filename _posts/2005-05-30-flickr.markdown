Well, I went for it and sprung for a pro account at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/users/redune">Flickr</a>.
        I will be uploading all of my photos there in the coming months.<br />
        <br />

        <br />
        <br />
        The pro account is restricted to uploading 1 GB per month so I can't upload it all
        at once, but a very large portion of my photos are there already. I am in the process
        of tagging and naming the photos, play around with the site, you should find it very
        fun to use. <img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=207" />
