So I realized that I really need to do groceries and laundry. So I changed the photo walk's destination to the grocery store.<br />
        Tried a bunch of fruit and vegtable photography. Its harder than you'd think. This
        apple shot is nice. But not quite what I was hoping for. Maybe my book has a chapter
        on Apples...<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=154" />
