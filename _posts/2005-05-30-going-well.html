I'm very excited at the moment. I get to finally see LL tommorow after three weeks of being apart. I talk to her pretty much every day, but it just isn't doing it for me any more. I need to see my sweetheart.<br />
        <br />
        I've got a great lazy evening planned. A nice salad with egg while watching the season
        premiere of The West Wing, and then I'll rest my brain for another mindless episode
        of Survivor. And then perhaps I'll have some nice Soul Calibur action. I've really
        gotta practice that because I got my butt handed to me when Mark came over, very embarassing
        for a gamer like me.
