So I had an excellent nite with Pete and LL yesterday. Had dinner at the Wave, came back and enjoyed some nice GTA action. And topped it all off with Ferris Bueler's Day off. All good fun. Plan to have some more of it tonight.
        I'm at the library right now. Gotta get that darn 342 assignment out of the way.
        Shouldn't be too bad, I think I've got a pretty good idea now of what I have to do.<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=465" />
