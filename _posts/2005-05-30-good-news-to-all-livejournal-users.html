As you can see I found a script which automatically posts all posts that I put up on <a href="http://www.redune.com">redune.com</a> onto
        my <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/redune/">livejournal</a>. So it'll be
        easier for all you livejournallers to keep up with me.<br />
        <br />
        Though I highly reccomend going to redune.com instead... It is much nicer looking,
        and the photos will be visible, it is likely not possible to set it up so that the
        photo links will work correctly.<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=87" />
