As you may remember, I was dissapointed when my site was rejected from the Adwords program.<br />
        But if you take a look a bit further down this page you can see that I was accepted.
        So redune.com is now advertising supported (I won't beg for donations any more).<br />
        I promise the advertising will never be intrusive. It will only ever take up space
        that would have otherwise been blank.<br />
        Let me know what you think.<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=93" />
