So I went to my Aunt Nancy's for lunch. Had a good time with the family and really enjoyed the food there. Great Lasagna and Desserts.<br />
        Then I did some shopping with my Mom, who is going to be in Waterloo until thursday
        morning. She let me know that it looks like they want to replace our Mazda, and guess
        who probably will get the old one? (I'm excited) May go car shopping with her some
        time this week. Depends on how late I work at MSW.<br />

        Came back to an apartment which is a mess from Pete's redoing of the bathroom. But
        it should be much better. He just put on a coat of primer, so much brighter!

        I saw this ballon when I stepped out onto the balcony. Makes a nice POTD I think!<br />
