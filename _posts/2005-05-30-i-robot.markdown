Now that's a great movie!<br />
        Just got back from seeing it with Pete. I can't recommend it enough. So much fun,
        great effects, and kept us wondering what was happening right to the end.<br />
        And it stayed far truer to Asimov's work than I thought it would.

        Can't wait for the DVD!<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=144" />
