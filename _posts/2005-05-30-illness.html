So, I've had a pretty rotten day today. I've felt very sick, tried, stuffed up and thirsty all day. I'm feeling a little better right now after having a nice bowl of ice cream, but we'll see how well that will hold up. I should be better tommorow after I have a nice long sleep tonight. I sure hope so.<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=165" />
