So, my Timmins trip was an absolute blast!<br />
        Defintely worth the 16+13 hours that I spent in transit. (Though flying would be a
        much better option for next time)<br />
        I'm in the process of making a much needed supper right now, I'll be posting my photos
        from the trip and a bit more about my time soon after supper.<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=113" />
