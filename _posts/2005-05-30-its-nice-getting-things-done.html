Well I ended up staying in the computer lab last night until 3AM, I missed my last bus (11:15PM) and had to get a ride back with my friend Chris.<br />
        Managed to make my CS307 assignment pretty much flawless. but it did mean that I ended
        up going with far less sleep than I hoped to get. I must catch up some day soon.<br />
        CS342 is all done now, due in 2 hours, all that is left is to put it into the locker.
        I'll do that after class.<br />
        Now for 340, then 350, then 342 again. All the while studying for three exams. But
        after it all is reading week!
        <br />
        Life is good<br />
