I am reposting old articles to bring them into the weblog system.<br />
        <br />
        This article is a statement about the public's obsession with privacy. Is privacy
        really nessecary?<br />
        <br />

        They are watching you. Everyday life always sends us this message; people are all
        worried that they are losing their privacy. But is this really a bad thing? What are
        we really going to lose if some computer in California knows that you regularly search
        for "Judy Dench" on Yahoo?<br />
        <br />
        Sure, all the pages that you visit record your every move and they do use this information
        to build an image of your personality. But they also use this information to improve
        their site. They see that not too many people are visiting a certain page, and change
        is so that the page is easier to find.<br />
        <br />
        The information they find is also used to personalize the site so that it is more
        attractive to you. For example, if you often click on pages about motorcycles, the
        site could use this information to show you more information on them. Do you hate
        seeing advertisements that you would never click on? Well the sites could use the
        information they collect about you to show you ads targeted to your tastes. For that
        motorcycle lover, he wouldn't want to see ads for a site where he can buy accessories
        for his Barbie dolls, wouldn't he rather see ads that show would let him find out
        about what he is interested in? That is precisely what the advertising companies are
        doing, they show him what they know he would be interested in.<br />
        <br />
        So, really, what have we got to lose if we let Big Brother poke his nose a little
        into our lives? He couldn't hurt us with the information, he could only make it better
        for us. <img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=71" />
