I took this on a wonderful photo walk that I took with LL on Sunday. It was so beautiful in London that day. You can see the rest of the great pictures at this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/redune/archives/date-taken/2005/01/30/">Flickr
        Gallery</a>.<br />

        This tree was standing by itself in someone's front lawn. It is nearly completely
        covered in snow. I was amazed that the bulbs are still on it.<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=220" />
