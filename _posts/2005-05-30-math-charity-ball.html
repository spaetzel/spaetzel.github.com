        LL and I went to the <a href="/spaetzel/www.uwaterloo.ca">University of Waterloo</a> <a href="http://www.mathsoc.uwaterloo.ca/">Math</a> Charity
        Ball last night and had a blast. It was so much fun, we had a great dinner, hung out
        with the few people there I knew (Ex <a href="http://www.maplesoft.com">Maplesoft</a> co-op's)
        and of course danced up a storm.<br />
        Yet again, LL was dancing circles around me, I think that the tap lessons she took
        years ago are still paying off. We even had a mini ballroom dancing lesson, I'm looking
        forward to next year when LL and I are planning on taking lessons.

        Take a look at the few pics I posted. Enjoy.<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=184" />
