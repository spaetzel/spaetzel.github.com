So I finally recieved the <a href="http://www.msndirect.com">Spot</a> <a href="http://www.msndirect.com/watches/abacus-wrist-net-round.htm">Watch</a> that
        I had sent off to be replaced. Sadly, I didn't get upgraded to a <a href="http://www.msndirect.com/watches/abacus-smart-watch.htm">nicer
        looking watch</a>, but is still <a href="http://www.msndirect.com/watches/abacus-wrist-net-round.htm">looks
        pretty cool</a>. For $10 you sure can't complain.<br />
        <br />
        It is pretty cool having all sorts of informatino available on my wrist. Now I'll
        always be able to find out what is going on in the world. Also, it allows you anyone
        on my MSN messenger list to send me a message direct to my watch.<br />
        <br />
        To send my watch a message, first add me to your contacts ( william AT redune DOT
        com ). Then right click on my name and choose "Send a Message to an MSN Direct Watch".
        Then you can send me whatever message you may feel.
        <br />
        <br />
        Give it a try, say whatever you want, I'd love to hear from you.<br />
        <br />
