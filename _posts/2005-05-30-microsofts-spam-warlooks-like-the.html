        Spam War</a>
        <br />
        Looks like the big guys are finally starting to take a stab at eliminating spam. Fingers
        crossed they're successful and aren't stopped like has happened to MSFT before as
        you can see <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/bluemt/">here</a>
        <br />
        Personally I'm loving the benefits of <a href="http://www.spamfighter.com/">Spamfighter</a> seems
        to be blocking about 95% of my spam and I very very rarely have an e-mail falsely
        labelled as spam, you should give it a try.<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=260" />
