Well I finally got to give my sweetie a big squish yesterday! It was so great finally being able to see her again. Sadly I didn't get very much time with her. First her family picked me up and took us to Western to move her back into residence. Then we went to the big event of the day. Her swimming test. A lot was leaning on this test. If she passed she would be able to leave today (Sunday) at 8:00 to a week long sailing trip. If she failed, she would stay in London and start classes on Thursday.  And of course my great girl struggled though and passed. This was wonderful for her, but there was one small problem... she had to leave at 8:00 instead of spending the weekend with me :-(.<br />
        Her parents drove me back to Waterloo today, where I had a nice lunch with Pete. But
        then I wasa left with little to do, I really miss LL and sure hoped to get more time
        with her than I did. Oh well, I am going to visit her next weekend and hopefully I'll
        be able to see her for a lot longer then.<br />

        On another note... it takes a long time to go through 1600 photos...<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=174" />
