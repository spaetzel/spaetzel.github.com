Today was a very snowy day. Not quite up to Dec 23rd, but it was a lot anyhow. A very nice light fluffy snow that was everywhere. I attempted to capture the feeling with this photo. I am going to have to figure out a good way to show off the falling snow. Perhaps a long exposure using a tripod. This shot is still nice though.<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=212" />
