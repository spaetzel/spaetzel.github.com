        have been using Mozilla Firebird for the last couple weeks, and have been loving it.
        Just today they released the latest version, now called Firefox. Its awesome. None
        of the bloat of Mozilla, all of the great features of Mozilla.<br />
        Get it and enjoy tabs, download manager, high security, and more. Its great<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=421" />
