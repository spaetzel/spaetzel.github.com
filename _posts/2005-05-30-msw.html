So it is all over. I had lots of fun at MSW. Hopefully we'll be doing it again next year and I'll be able to take part in it again. It was wonderful being able to put faces to all of those people that are always talked about at work.<br />
        <br />
        I got to go car shopping with my Mom after work. That was fun. Test drove a Toyota
        Camry and a Honda Accord. The Accord is very nice. To bad I'd never be able to drive
        it much. Maybe I'll buy myself one some day...<br />
        <br />
        I've got to clean up my room. It's been getting just as messy as the rest of the apartment
        which I can't stand.<br />
        <br />
        I'l leave you with yet another photo of Laurier archicture. This time from the science
        building.<br />
        <br />
        Also you can <a href="http://www.redune.com/downloads/MSW.zip">download the .zip file
        of all of the pictures from MSW</a> that I took or other people took using my camera.<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=139" />
