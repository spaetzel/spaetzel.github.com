So a great week has come to an end, I had so much fun with LL and am definitely looking forward to seeing her again on Thursday.<br />
        <br />
        She is currently on her way back to Timmins, and I am hoping that the huge amount
        of snow that is out there doesn't hold the bus back. She is so looking forward to
        seeing her family and would be so upset if she had to wait longer to see them.<br />
        <br />
        The snow held me back this morning though. The sidewalks hadn't been plowed yet so
        I had to trudge very slowly though the foot of snow that was there. I was very tired
        by the time I reached the bus stop. And then, of course, the bus is late. It certainly
        makes sense, the roads are so covered that everyone is moving slowly. I hope that
        all of the travellers that are heading to see their family for Christmas make it there
        ok.<br />
        <br />
        My christmas festivities will be starting tommorrow when my parents and brother arrive
        at my apartment. I am defintely looking forward to that. There definitely will be
        a bunch of cleaning to be done when I get back home.
        <br />
        <br />
        And if I don't post again, Merry Christmas everybody!<br />
