Pete and I were followed by this car for a while on our way back to Waterloo from Port Elgin. I was hoping that it would pass us so that I could get a better look at it and figure out what it is.<br />
        <br />
        Perhaps one of you can name what kind of car it is. Solve a dilemma for me please!<br />
