I was watching TV in my new apartment when I looked out the window and saw this glorious sunset.  I ran to get my camera and tripod. It made for an excellent subject (Pete you really missed out)<br />
        I had fun messing with many different camera settings trying to get the perfect shot,
        check out my favorite of them all. And then check out the rest of the photos in the
        gallery.<br />
        I thought it would be perfect for the <a href="http://www.photofriday.com">Photofriday</a> of
        this week as well. Becuase what is more natural and untouched by man than the sun?<br />
