        I have set up a new way to view my POTDs. The new site displays the latest picture.
        As well as the 5 most recent thumbnails.
        <br />
        <br />
        All POTDs will be visible at both sites. So now you have the option as to how you
        would like to view the site.<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=159" />
