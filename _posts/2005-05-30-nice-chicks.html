I'd been meaning to take a photo of the ducks that swim in the creek right by my building for a while now, just was always in a hurry to be somewhere. Today I saw a nice duck on the bank so I got out my camera. Just as I got it out I see this mother run into the water with her whole family. I was so lucky to see so many newborn chicks. <br />
        Sadly the pics came out quite out of focus, I'm not sure why. Maybe I need to bring
        my tripod with me next time...<br />
