I found this over at <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000733023826/">Engadget</a>.
        Check <a href="http://www.bmezine.com/news/pubring/20041214.html">out these glasses.</a> They
        are a set of glasses that are mounted using a nose piercing. There is nothing that
        visibly connects the lenses and there are no arms. The author talks about how he wore
        them for several days without taking them off, even sleeping with them.<br />
        <br />
        This is very odd, but it could be convenient. What do you think, should I get a set
        of them once they are released?<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=190" />
