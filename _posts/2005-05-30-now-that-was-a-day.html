So, I'm about to finish one rather signifigant day.<br />
        <br />
        Got up, got to work as normal. Had a fairly standard morning fixing some stupid user
        submitted Maple apps. Midway though the morning I get an email from the VP of our
        department; apparently he had brought in some beer and wine that was sitting around
        in his apartment, and he was going to dole it out to us at 4:30.

        So, spent the afternoon doing more repairs, and learning Labview (kinda cool, but
        don't yet see the point)<br />
        Then the time for beer comes around. Enjoyed a couple Small Tim Horton's cups of Beck
        beer. Pretty good stuff. Got to listen to Tom (the VP) discussing with Soo (a fellow
        newb at Maplesoft) how cool it is they are both Korean. I must say, its rather nice
        being paid signifigant amounts of money to dring beer....<br />
        <br />
        Ended up hanging out at the office until 7:15 or so. Had a great time listening to
        (having trouble taking part in) discussions on the differences between Korean, Chinese
        and Japanese, and then watching (in slight awe) at attempts to explain some crazy
        mathematical theorems (Brings up wonderful memories of 222 and 223 [take that Waterloo
        majors] )<br />
        <br />
        Decided that I really needed to get back home or I was going to starve very soon.
        So on the way back down the street I see Pete walking away from our building, so I
        crossed and chatted with him. Apparenlty he was off to do some work at Laurier and
        then to find out where he could locate his current infatuation. He said he'd call
        me if they were going to a bar.<br />
        <br />
        I got back and microwaved the Schnitzel that my Oma had given me (mmm, thanks Oma).
        And Pete came back just as I was finishing up. He didn't have any luck locating his
        Girl. So we decided after watching some TV that we would go looking in the Bar that
        he though she'd be in (even though she's 18)<br />
        <br />
        We head to the Heuther hotel and go looking all over in there with no luck. So we
        decide to go for a walk. We then run into a friend of Pete's who tells us that there
        is a party in the Heuther, but in the one room (of very many) we didn't check. So
        back we go, and there the party is (But not Pete's girl still)<br />
        <br />
        Got to listen to some nice music conversations (I've done a lot of listening today
        eh) We then left with Marie and walked back to her place, were we ended up hanging
        to avoid the huge amounts of rain. Eventually Pete finally decided he had enough,
        (at 12:15) so we walked back (still in a drizzle of rain)<br />
        <br />
        So, here we are. A rather fun filled day. Only one thing that I really missed doing
        (That certain someone knows what I'm talking about)<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=104" />
