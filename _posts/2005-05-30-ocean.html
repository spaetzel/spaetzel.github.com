This week's Photofriday theme, Ocean, is a little bit unfair.  Hard to get a good shot of the ocean when you live in Southern Ontario. So I decided to take a shot of the "Ocean" that is close to me.<br />
        <br />
        This was an accidental shot. You can see what happened. However when I saw it, I really
        liked it. Take a look and let me know if you agree.<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=141" />
