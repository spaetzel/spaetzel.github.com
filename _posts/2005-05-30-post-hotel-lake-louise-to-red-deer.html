Here is where we really experience the rockies. <br />
        First of are a few more photos of the Post Hotel.<br />
        Then we go on a hike up in the mountains behind Lake Lousie. It is so gorgeous up
        there. I want to go back and spend a few weeks just hiking in the mountains.<br />
        Finally are pictures of our drive to Red Deer where we were going to meet my brother.
