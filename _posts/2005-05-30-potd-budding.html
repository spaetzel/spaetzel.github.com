Such a beautiful day today. So bright, its a shame that I had to spend the day in the library studying. <br />
        It'll be all over soon, horray!<br />
        <br />
        I ended up walking more of the way to campus this afternoon than anticipated, but
        it meant that I got to see parts of the campus I haven't seen in a while. They really
        need to mow in the lawn in front of TRAC, as you can see here:<br />
