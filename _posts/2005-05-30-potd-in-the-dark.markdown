A really late POTD today. So late that it's not even on the right day. Was a very busy day. Spent about 5 hours studying for an exam that still was incredibly terrible.<br />
        <br />
        This photo is here to make up for yesterday's shot. Middlesex College is actually
        a very nice building (on the outside). This is a photo taken as I leave the building
        after handing in my assignement for the same class that I wrote the exam for.<br />
