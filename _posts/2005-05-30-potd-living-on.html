        I've had this poinsetta for more than a month now. Its survived a trip to Port Elgin,
        and back. And its still living on. It looses a leaf every once and a while, but it
        still looks good. Good enough for its own photo shoot. Here is the best - With a bit
        of tweaking.<br />
