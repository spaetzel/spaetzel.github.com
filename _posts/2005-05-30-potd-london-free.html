I really like this new thing I'm doing with photoshop. When you raise the contrast you can make a relatively dull photo absolutely stunning.<br />

        Today was a very grey day, the <a href="http://www.redune.com/photos/2004_02_09 - London Free/London Free0001.JPG">original
        photo</a> captured the greyness very well. However the modified version shows how
        I feel. Things are going so well even though I have to do so much all at once these
        days.<br />
