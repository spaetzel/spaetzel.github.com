Sorry about the missing two days. Large amounts of busyness have kept me from taking photos.
        LL got me this great frame for V-day. Thanks so much, it is so great.
        Thought it would be cool to take a photo of photos in my new frame, so here it is:
        <center><a href="http://www.redune.com/photos/Edited/Nice Framing_l.jpg"><img src="http://www.redune.com/photos/Edited/Nice Framing_m.jpg" border= 0></a>
        </center>
        <img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=433" />
