<a href="http://www.photofriday.com"><img src="../images/photofriday.gif" alt="Photo Friday" width="194" height="39" border="0" align="right"></a>Here
        is my third entry into the weekly Photo Friday challenge. Photo Friday is a weekly
        challenge where a single word is given and photographers are asked to take a photo
        that captures that word.<br />
        <br />
        This week's challenge is Abstract.
        <br />
        The subject here is something that I've noticed several times in the past, thinking
        it would make an intersting photo. Here it is, looking down the stairwell in from
        the <a href="http://westernmustangband.tripod.com">WMB</a> Band room.
