        is my first entry into the weekly <a href="http://www.photofriday.com">Photo Friday</a> challenge.
        Photo Friday is a weekly challenge where a single word is given and photographers
        are asked to take a photo that captures that word.>
        <br />
        This week's challenge is Emptiness.
