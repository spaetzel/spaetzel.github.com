        is my fourth entry into the weekly Photo Friday challenge. Photo Friday is a weekly
        challenge where a single word is given and photographers are asked to take a photo
        that captures that word. This week's challenge is Perspective. Clearly the subject
        of this shot has a bit of a perspective problem. I guess someone who owns a TT Roadster
        must have permission to park wherever he wants.
