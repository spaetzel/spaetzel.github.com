So my sweetie surprised me by calling up and asking "Is it ok if I come over for a bit?" Guess at my reply...<br />
        She said she was only going to stay for an hour or so, thus I was very curious as
        to her reason for coming.
        <br />
        Lo and behold when she gets off the bus she is holding this beautiful rose for me.
        The first flowers that anyone has ever bought me <img alt=":-)" src="smilies/happy.gif">
        <br />
        <br />
        Here is the rose she bought for me:<br />

        I took a bunch of photos today, so beautiful out, the trees are starting to flower.
        You'll enjoy the rest of the photos I took as well. You can see them <a href="../gallery/gallery.aspx?gallery=2004_04_24 - Flowers">here</a><img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=85" />
