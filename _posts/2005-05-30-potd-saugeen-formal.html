I had a blast at the Saugeen formal last night, lots of people there. One person in particular I was happy to be with. Also ran into a friend from Port Elgin, crazy coincidence I suppose.
        I can't wait till my next chance to get all dressed up for my sweetheart.
        I took a bunch of photos a the formal, here is one particularly cool one.
