So today was one of my best days ever. Observent folk will look below and see just why that is.<br />
        I'm going to be working at <a href="http://www.maplesoft.com">Maplesoft</a> for 16
        months starting in May. I am so excited. It will be so great working on such cool
        software. Western students who don't know what Maple is, head to any PC lab and load
        it up, it can do so many cool things, and I'll get to add to it!<br />
        <br />
        Anyhow, I thought that this picture showed how well the beautiful weather reflected
        my wonderful day.<br />
