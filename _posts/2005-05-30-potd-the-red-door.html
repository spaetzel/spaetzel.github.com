Well I just got home a couple minutes ago. Long day of coding today. Went well, I'm glad to be back in the mode again.<br />
        Took a couple photos in the evening, sadly most of them I had the camera in the wrong
        mode, will have to take them again later. This one was pretty nice though, tried to
        capture the menacing look of this door. Didn't quite get it, but I think I know what
        to do better next time.<br />
