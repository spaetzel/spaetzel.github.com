Apparently the Prime Minister was at Western yesterday. I can't say for sure because I wasn't able to see him. But it didn't stop me from standing there with the rest of the crowd hoping to see him leave the building.<br />
        Although I left at just the right time, got to see another very important person instead.<br />
