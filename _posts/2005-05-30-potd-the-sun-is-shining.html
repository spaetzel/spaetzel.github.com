It was a very beautiful day today. The sun was so very bright, excellent for melting that March snow that we just got.
        Finally got to meet LLs parents today. That went well. Had a good time. Looking forward to breakfast tommorow too.
        Now I've gotta get that darn assignment done. Its not fun when your program keeps on crashing you computer...
