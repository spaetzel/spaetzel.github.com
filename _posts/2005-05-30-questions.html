        I've been strongly thinking about getting myself a <a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/template.php?cat=1&grp=2&productNr=25214">Nikon
        D70</a>. I'm itching for more flexibility in a camera. <a href="http://consumer.usa.canon.com/ir/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&fcategoryid=145&modelid=8776">The
        Canon A70</a> I'm using right now is great, as you can see from all of the photos
        that I've posted. But I know that the Nikon, being an SLR camera would let me do so
        much more, huge amounts of zoom, easy access to aperture, shutter and white balance
        settings, long exposures, interchangable lenses, huge resolution.
        <br />
        <br />
        It would be a really nice camera to take to Europe too.
        <br />
        <br />
        The question, is this though, is it worth the $2000? I would still use the A70 a lot
        as an SLR is too big to carry around in my backpack. I even have ideas that I may
        be able to get the Nikon to pay for itself by starting a photography business...<br />
        <br />
        Please give me your opinion!<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=152" />
