<b>Redune in <i>Aftermath: Differentiation</i></b>
        <br />
        In this edge-of-your-seat masterpiece, Redune (Denzel Washington) is an ex-hitman
        with a less than relevant background. He needs to find Lil-one (Jane Seymour) before
        his former partner, Xian (The Rock), kidnaps her. Without ever taking time to reload,
        he demolishes a subterranean stronghold, just as the opening credits finish. Buy it
        on DVD for the interactive menus.<div style="text-align: center;">
