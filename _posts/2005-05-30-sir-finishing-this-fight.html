Well I just beat Halo 2.<br />
        <br />
        Excellent game. I enjoyed myself every moment of it, I was never frustrated, I never
        thought that it was just holding me back. And now I know I've got hours of multiplayer
        ahead of me.<br />
        <br />
        The ending is such a cliffhanger though! I really want to finish the story, as is,
        there is so much left to do!<br />
        <br />
        I've heard that apparently when you beat the game on Legendary, it displays in the
        credits "Coming Feb 9", I sure hope that means that the rest of the story will become
        available, either being unlocked from the disc, being downloadable, or being able
        to buy Halo 3. Who knows.... something is going to happen, it's gotta!<br />
        <br />
        So I just began the wait.<br />
        <br />
        If you haven't bought it yet, go buy it now!<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=185" />
