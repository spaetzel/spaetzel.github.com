So my bedroom got painted yesterday, its a very nice bright blue color. <br />
        I am now in the process of setting up the room for good now. Definitely looking forward
        to having this all set up. I'm just going to have to make sure not to spend too much
        time in here. The paint fumes are already getting to me.<br />
        I'll put up photos of the room when I'm all done.<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=96" />
