I don't know why. But I just haven't been updating the site lately.
        I blame it on the weird weather lately.
        Friday was beautiful, but for the 1/2 hour that I was outside I was on my way to a meeting, no time to stop and look at the beautiful weather and take a photo.
        The weekend has been very dreary too (Though I spent a lot of time looking at one thing that is rather beautiful last night)
        Fingers crossed it'll be nice tommorow and I'll get back into the grind.
        All my midterms are now over, great feeling.  The big project lately has been and will be for a while my CS307 Assignment, Implementing the board game, "The Settlers of Catan" It should be good. I may even post the final product up here once its all said and done!<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=454" />
