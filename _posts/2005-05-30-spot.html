Well, the <a href="http://www.msndirect.com/watches/abacus-wrist-net-round.htm">Spot
        Watch</a> that I ordered on Wednesday has finally arrived. It is sitting on its cradle
        charging away. Its been doing that since 11:30 this morning, I sure hope it finishes
        soon.<br />
        <br />
        I'm very excited to play with this new gadget that I got for $9.95 after rebate. It
        will let me get news, weather, e-mail and even MSN mesenger messages on my watch.<br />
        <br />
        I plan to set up a script that will let users send messages to my watch. It should
        be cool. I'll probably follow up once I get the thing working.<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=187" />
