<strong>Charity Ball</strong>
        <br />
        Well I had a blast last night at the charity ball. There was lots and lots of standing
        in line, but when you shove that many people all into a room these things are going
        to happen. Just need to have some patience.<br />
        I casn see that the USC really put a lot of work into the event, and I'm glad that
        my money has gone off to a couple good causes (The London Humane Society, and the
        Alhzeimer's society)<br />
        <br />
        Anyhow, if you want to see the pics from the night, click <a href="http://www.redune.com/gallery/gallery.aspx?gallery=2004_01_31%20-%20Charity%20Ball">here</a>
