<strong>Desktop Sidebar</strong>
        <br />
        I just discovered this awesome program, <a href="http://www.desktopsidebar.com/">Desktop
        Sidebar</a> Works like the sidebar that you (probably haven't) seen in Longhorn screenshots.
        E-mail checker, photo slideshow, analog clock, performance meter, RSS newsreader.
        Awesome.<br />
        Take a look at the screenshot.<br />

        background, you can <a href="http://www.redune.com/Photos/2004_02_04%20-%20The%20Ents/_1152/The%20Ents0006.JPG">download
