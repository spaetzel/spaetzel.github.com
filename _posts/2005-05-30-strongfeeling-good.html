<strong>Feeling good</strong>
        <br />
        Had a great day today (I guess that was yesterday by now, but who's counting?) I started
        it off with 10 hours of sleep, now I'm definitely caught up from all that time being
        awake over the weekend. Had a nice Psych class with LL, then I kinda understood my
        350 class...<br />
        When I got home I read some psych, getting ready for the exam on Thursday. I'm feeling
        good about it, I really like the new prof for the course.<br />
        <br />
        I fill out a couple more internship applications... Then I got an e-mail I've been
        waiting for for a long time - Made my day.<br />
        <br />
        Now I'm just waiting for a phone call...<br />
