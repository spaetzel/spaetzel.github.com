<strong>Live from Western Gibfest</strong>
        <br />
        Well it looks like everything here is going well. Was a bit of a mixup at the beginning
        of the day.
        <br />
        First off we couldn't find one exec member's house to pick him up.<br />
        Then when we try to go to U-Haul to pick up our van, Yellowpages.ca has the wrong
        address!<br />
        So we had to drive for 20 minutes just to get to U-Haul.<br />
        Then when we get there there is no van for us! They never put our reservation into
        the system! So we've been doing all the pickups with one less car then expected -
        Big pain in the butt!<br />
