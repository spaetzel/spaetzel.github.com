<strong>Mornings...</strong>
        <br />
        I just got up. I full 45 Minutes earlier than I expected. This is getting wierd, I've
        been waking up way before my alarm goes off very often lately. Mabye my body is starting
        to really become accustomed to the university lifestyle, "Who needs sleep?"<br />
        <br />
        Guess it's all good. Gives me time to go make pancakes. Now the only problem is that
        I have to wash a pan first...<br />
