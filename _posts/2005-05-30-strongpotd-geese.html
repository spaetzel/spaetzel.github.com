<strong>POTD: Geese on the Thames</strong>
        <br />
        There are lots of advantages of attending <a href="http://www.uwo.ca">Canada's Most
        Beautiful university</a>. One of which is the opportunity to take lots of beautiful
        pictures.<br />
        There are often Geese swimming around in the river, but not so often with so much
        snow all around<br />
