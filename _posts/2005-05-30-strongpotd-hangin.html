<strong>POTD: Hanging Right</strong>
        <br />
        No the lamp isn't bent. Though it is shaped oldly. I took this photo realizing that
        I had a cool subject just waiting there (been in need of a bulb for a long time, dang
        oddball bulbs)<br />
        Kind of neat. Too much work today to go out and do a proper shoot.<br />
