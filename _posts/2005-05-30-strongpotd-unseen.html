<strong>POTD: Unseen Angle</strong>
        <br />
        So many people take photos of Middlesex from the front, no one seeing the back of
        the building which is also rather nice. It is odd how the building juts out so much,
        but it creates an interesting curve to base the clock tower upon. Bonus points to
        who can guess what time I took this shot.<br />

        I took a lot of shots around campus today, take a look at them <a href="http://www.redune.com/gallery/gallery.aspx?gallery=2004_02_04 - The Ents">here</a>
        <br />
        If you're wondering I stole the gallery title from the <a href="http://www.gazette.uwo.ca/">Gazette</a>.
        Huge bonus points if you can name the building I'm referrring to<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=397" />
