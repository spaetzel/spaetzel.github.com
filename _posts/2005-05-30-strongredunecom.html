<strong>Redune.com, now faster!</strong>
        <br />
        Netscape users may have noticed that the site rendered oddly. This was caused by using
        JavaScript to include the Blogroll and BlogSnob code.<br />
        I have replaced the JavaScript by including an RSS feed instead. So now all the processing
        is done at the server, thus much faster and elegant for you.<br />
