<strong>Spyware free Real player</strong>
        <br />
        Found this blurb <a href="http://boingboing.net/2004_02_01_archive.html#107565322512239056">here</a>,
        rather usefull I think:<br />
        "The BBC made a unique deal with Real Networks which disposes of their spyware tactics.
        Basically, if a user clicks on a link to download Real Player from a BBC website,
        the referrer script sends them to a page where they can download an expiry-free, spyware-free
        and nuicance-free version of the player. It's because the BBC have such a stringent
        public service remit, that it was offensive to charge people a license fee for BBC
        content, then make them pay all over again for the facility to view/listen to it"<br />
