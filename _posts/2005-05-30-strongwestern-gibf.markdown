<strong>Western Gibfest - Awesome</strong>
        <br />
        Well Western Gibfest is all over now, it was a blast. A whole lot more gaming than
        I would ever do in a day.<br />
        I just got up from catching up on 40 hours with only 4 hours of sleep. Feeling much
        better now.<br />
        At the gibfest I was one of the lucky few, and I won a new PC case. Xentia is now
        sitting inside of a nice Antec Performance Plus case. Looking pretty sweet. I'm going
        to be formatting the main HD soon - want to get things running smoothly again.<br />
