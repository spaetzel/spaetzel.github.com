        Steve Jobs just announced these two products a few minutes ago. Here are the links
        to the offical product pages at apple.com.<br />

        The Mac mini is very tempting, a Macintosh that costs less than $1000, actually it
        is $500, that is quite doable, I'll have to wait and see the reviews.

        The iPod shuffle is an interesting idea, but I do already have a full blown iPod,
        so going for a tiny flash based iPod with no screen doesn't seem too useful. I'd like
        to play with it, but it doesn't do it for me.<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=203" />
