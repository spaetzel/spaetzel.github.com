        The joys of backwards compatibility...<br />

        Does the statement, "We've always done it that way" ring any bells?
        <br />
        The US standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet, 8.5 inches.
        That's an exceedingly odd number. Why was that gauge used? Because that's the way
        they built them in England, and English expatriates built the US Railroads.<br />
        Why did the English build them like that? Because the first rail lines were built
        by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that's the gauge they
        used.
        <br />
        <!--more-->
        <br />
        Why did "they" use that gauge then? Because the people who built the tramways used
        the same jigs and tools that they usedfor building wagons, which used that wheel spacing.<br />
        Okay! Why did the wagons have that particular odd wheel spacing? Well, if they tried
        to use any other spacing, the wagon wheels would break on some of the old, long distance
        roads in England, because that's the spacing of the wheel ruts.
        <br />
        So who built those old rutted roads? Imperial Rome built the first long distance roads
        in Europe (and England) for their legions. The roads have been used ever since.
        <br />
        And the ruts in the roads? Roman war chariots formed the initial ruts, which everyone
        else had to match for fear of destroying their wagon wheels. Since the chariots were
        made for Imperial Rome, they were all alike in the matter of wheel spacing..<br />
        The United States standard railroad gauge of 4 feet, 8.5 inches is derived from the
        original specifications for an Imperial Roman war chariot. And bureaucracies live
        forever.
        <br />
        So the next time you are handed a specification and wonder what horse's ass came up
        with it, you may be exactly right, because the Imperial Roman army chariots were made
        just wide enough to accommodate the back ends of two war horses.
        <br />
        Now the twist to the story<br />
        When you see a Space Shuttle sitting on its launch pad, there are two big booster
        rockets attached to the sides of the main fuel tank. These are solid rocket boosters,
        or SRBs. The SRBs are made by Thiokol at their factory at Utah. The engineers who
        designed the SRBs would have preferred to make them a bit fatter, but the SRBs had
        to be shipped by train from the factory to the launch site. The railroad line from
        the factory happens to run through a tunnel in the mountains. The SRBs had to fit
        through that tunnel. The tunnel is slightly wider than the railroad track, and the
        railroad track, as you now know, is about as wide as two horses' behinds.
        <br />
        So, a major Space Shuttle design feature of what is arguably the world's most advanced
        transportation system was determined over two thousand years ago by the width of a
        horse's ass.<br />></blockquote>
