I came home from biking today to find the Tile guy still here. I was so glad to see that he did come today. Him calling last night made me very afraid that he wasn't going to come at all. <br />
        All of the tile is now in place. All that is left for him to do is put the grout in
        between the tiles.<br />
        Looks like I'll be showering on Wednesday. Horray!<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=147" />
