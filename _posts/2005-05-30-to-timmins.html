Here are the first photos from my Timmins trip.<br />
        They start off with a picture of my first bus of the trip. Turns out that I managed
        to miss my 8:45 bus by showing up at 8:30, so I ended up taking this one which was
        an Express to Toronto. So instead of going though Guelph and Cambridge I went straight
        to Toronto, so it was a good turn of events.<br />
        But showing up early to Toronto just meant that I had even more time to kill before
        I could catch my 12:30Am bus to Timmins, 2 and a half to be exact. So I killed time
        by wandering downtown Toronto. See if you can name all the places that I saw.
        <br />
        Not that many, but enough for a bunch of nice pictures.<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=108" />
