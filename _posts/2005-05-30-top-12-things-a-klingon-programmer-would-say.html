        Now for a truly nerdy moment. I found this in a comment over at <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot<br />
        </a>
        <br />
        12. Specifications are for the weak and timid!<br />
        11. This machine is a piece of GAGH! I need dual Pentium processors if Iam to do battle
        with this code!<br />
        10. You cannot really appreciate Dilbert unless you've read it in the original Klingon.<br />
        9. Indentation?! -- I will show you how to indent when I indent your skull!<br />
        8. What is this talk of 'release'? Klingons do not make software' releases'. Our software
        'escapes' leaving a bloody trail of designers and quality assurance people in its
        wake.<br />
        7. Klingon function calls do not have 'parameters' -- they have 'arguments' -- and
        they ALWAYS WIN THEM.<br />
        6. Debugging? Klingons do not debug. Our software does not coddle the weak.<br />
        5. I have challenged the entire quality assurance team to a Bat-Leth contest. They
        will not concern us again.<br />
        4. A TRUE Klingon Warrior does not comment his code!<br />
        3. By filing this SPR you have challenged the honor of my family. Prepare to die!<br />
        2. You question the worthiness of my code? I should kill you where you stand!<br />
        1. Our users will know fear and cower before our software. Ship it! Ship it, and let
        them flee like the dogs they are!<br />
