So, I have reached the ultimate goal of all nerdom. Well maybe not the ultimate goal, but its pretty darn close.<br />
        <br />
        I came back from another photo walk and found that my story submission to <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> had
        been posted onto their front page! <a href="http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/07/24/1814210&tid=211">Read
        the article here</a>.<br />
        <br />
        I know most of my readers don't frequent Slashdot. But I'm pretty darn proud of this
        myself. (Plus it means that I've already gotten 100 clicks off of just that article,
        and its only been up an hour!<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=156" />
