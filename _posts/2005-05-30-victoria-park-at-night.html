        I took this photo a few weeks ago on the way home from the Kitchener<br />
        <br />
        Musical Society Band practice.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        There are lots of lights all set up around Victoria park in Kitchener,<br />
        <br />
        it is very nice.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        But I can't wait to take LL through Waterloo park to see the huge<br />
        <br />
        amount of lights that they have set up there!
