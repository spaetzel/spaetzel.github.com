Well I just spent the weekend seting up my main desktop as my new webserver. I realized that there was no reason not to use my laptop (Goliath) as my main machine, and then turn my desktop into the webserver. <br />
        <br />
        The reason that I wanted to do this is because the website that I am working on needs
        some very serious horsepower, so Xentia can provide far more than Hyperion ever was
        able to.<br />
        <br />
        We'll see how this goes over.<br />
        <br />
        Also, I've upgraded to Wordpress 1.5, which screwed up my old style so I am currently
        using the default Wordpress style, I'll customize it soon...<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=230" />
