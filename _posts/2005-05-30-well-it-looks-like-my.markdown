Well it looks like my semester is off to a good start. <br />
        My first class CS340 looks like it may be a little tough - But I think the prof should
        do a good job explaining it. The little bit he did today was well done.<br />
        My other class CS342 had a lot more to take in, but I'm excited. I'm always up for
        learning new programming languages (Instead of learning ones I already know again,
        horray CS307)<br />
        Went to the mall after class with Laura-Lee, had lots of fun.
        <br />
        Got some more internship supplies - Real nice paper that will actually photocopy well
        this time. Also deposited my rebate cheques that finally showed up (I sent away for
        them early October)<br />
        <br />
        Going to get writing those cover letters now. Booyeah!<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=280" />
