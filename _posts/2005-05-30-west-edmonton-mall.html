Here are pictures taken from the <a href="http://www.westedmall.com ">West Edmonton
        Mall</a>.<br />
        Pretty cool place, basically contains an entire amusment park, a small one, but still.
        <br />
        The roller coaster there is one of the best I've ever been on, they did such a good
        job with the small amount of space. So fast and turns to quickly, its great (Though
        it is very expensive)<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=66" />
