So I went to my Oma's house for dinner tonight. Had a nice grandmotherly cooked meal of schnitzel, mmm. Now I've even got leftovers, schnitzel tommorow too horray!<br />
        I'll be going there again next week, will be nice getting a weekly meal, especially
        if I get leftovers every time. If things keep up this way, I'll barely ever have to
        cook myself.<br />
        <br />
        So my tante drove me back, and turned into the wrong driveway. It turned out nicely
        though, becuase I noticed this tree and whipped out the camera. Enjoy!<br />
