        You all know the feeling - Seeing something that you really thought would have made
        a great photo, only to not have your camera with you.<br />
        <br />
        Well today, as with every Thursday my backpack was quite full and I didn't bring my
        camera with me. When I was coming back from band practice I see a small rabbit standing
        on the sidewalk ahead of me very peacefully.<br />
        I magaged to get pretty close to him before he ran off.
        <br />
        <br />
        It was a very pretty scene, lots of snow all around, rabbit sniffing away.
        <br />
        <br />
        Hopefully my description will be good enough, I'll sure try to always have my camera
        with me from now on!<br />
