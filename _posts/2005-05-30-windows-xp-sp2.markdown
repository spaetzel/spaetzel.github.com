Microsoft has finally released Service Pack 2 for Windows XP. I highly recommend that every XP user install it. It contains may important improvements, most notably Security enhancements, such as Spyware blockers, Built in firewall, Pop-up blocker and more.<br />
        <br />
        It will be available from Windows Update soon, or you can download the file directly
        from Microsoft <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=049C9DBE-3B8E-4F30-8245-9E368D3CDB5A&displaylang=en">here</a><img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=166" />
