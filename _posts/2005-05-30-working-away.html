So today was a pretty productive day. I did a bunch of shopping around after work, did my weekly Future Shop visit. Bought a nice costume for Halloween (A prince, but which prince? You'll have to guess). <br />
        <br />
        I then visited EB where I saw that they already have the PStwo, I thought it didn't
        come out until November, I'm definitely considering getting myself one of those, they
        look awful great, and I have a bunch of PS2 games that I'm dying to try.
        <br />
        <br />
        Also, it looks like they'll be opening up at 12:00 AM on Nov 9. hmm, perhaps I'll
        find myself there, take a nap right after work in the 8th, and then Halo 2 it like
        mad all night... Maybe it'll work, maybe its stupid. We'll see. <img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=182" />
