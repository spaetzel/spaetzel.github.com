I have created a php script entitled Flickrpress. This script will get all of the photos uploaded to <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a> by
        a specific user in the last 24 hours. It will then post the thumbnails to a <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> blog.
        You can see the results <a href="http://www.redune.com/wp/index.php?p=513">here</a>.<br />
        <!--more-->
        <br />
        <br />
        To use the script, just download the source and place it on your web server. Then
        set up the script file to be run daily. The full instructions are located in the source
        file.<br />

        Please add any questions or suggestions to the comments. Any feedback would be appreciated!<br />
