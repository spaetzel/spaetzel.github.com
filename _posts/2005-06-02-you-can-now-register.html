When I first set up the site the system was not able to send out confirmation e-mails to people who attempted to register.<br />
        <br />
        I just fixed the problem so you should be able to register no problem. You will need
        to register if you want to post comments. So please, go ahead and <a href="/spaetzel/user/register">sign
        up</a>.<br />
        <br />
        Edit: So, I initially thought that I had gotten it working. After having lots of trouble,
        I almost gave up. Then I switched to using a different MTA and it worked right away.
        Annoying, but it works again. <img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=495" />
