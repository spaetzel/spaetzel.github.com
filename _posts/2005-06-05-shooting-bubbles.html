So based on suggestions from my girlfriend's mother, I went out this afternoon to try and take photos of bubbles.<br />
        <br />
        I took out my trusty D70, my tripod and the bubbles that LL gave me for my "summer
        birthday" last year. I set everything all up behind my apartment building.
        <br />
        <br />
        Turns out that it is actually very difficult to shoot the things. Since they move
        so quickly, and I was so concerned about getting bubbles all over my camera, I wasn't
        able to get any good shots of bubbles. I need to try and do this again with a phootgraphic
        assistant. (I'm looking at you, LL) Maybe having somebody else blowing the bubbles
        and having me behind the camera, it would be a lot easier.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'll post a couple shots to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/redune">Flickr</a>,
        I haven't looked at them all yet. Maybe one or two are decent. <img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=499" />
