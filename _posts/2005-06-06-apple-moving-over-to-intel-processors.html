So the rumours that have been flying about are true. All Apple Macintosh computers in the future will be running on Intel processors. This means that all software written for OS X  will have to be rebuilt for the new machines. <br />
        <br />
        I had been dreaming of buying myself a Mac, I wasn't planning on getting one soon,
        but now I know for sure that I won't be buying one for a while. We will probably have
        to wait until at least Spring 2006 before the first Intel based Macintoshes come out.
        Any Macs bought now will be obsolete very quickly.
        <br />
        <br />
        What do I think of the move? I don't know. It it funny thinking that a Macintosh will
        be running the same hardware as the PC that I am using now. All that seperates them
        is the Operating System.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm curious to see how this will resonate throughout the tech world.
