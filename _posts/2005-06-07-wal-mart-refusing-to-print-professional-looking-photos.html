I just came across <a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/computing/personaltech/20050530-9999-mz1b30snap.html">this
        article</a> which talks about how Wal-Mart is refusing to print photos that customers
        bring in that they belive to have been taken by a professional.
        <br />
        <br />
        Wal-Mart is afraid that people might be trying to print copyrighted photos without
        permission. This restriction has caused many amateur photographers to have lots of
        trouble getting their shots printed. For example, a man who wanted photos of his mother
        for her funeral couldn't get them printed because Wal-Mart thought that they were
        taken by a pro.<br />
        <br />
        This is a ridiculous policy, how can they judge which photos are pro or not. I guess
        it comes down to this: If you take good photos, don't take them to Wal-Mart.<br />
