At an event last night held in Lucas's honor by the American Film institute, George Lucas admitted that he is not a great writer.<br />
        <br />
        He admits that he is resposible for "Wooden dialog", at least Francis Ford Coppola
        (creator of The Godfather) helped Lucas. As George says, ""He took me from not being
        able to write a word in terms of writing screenplays to being the king of wooden dialogue,"<br />
