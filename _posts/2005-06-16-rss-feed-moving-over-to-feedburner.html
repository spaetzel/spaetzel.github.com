Today I moved the RSS feed of Redune over to Feedburner, this is to allow a bunch of new functionality including enhanced statistics. <br />
        <br />
        The new feed URL is <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/redune">http://feeds.feedburner.com/redune</a>.<br />
        <br />
        No worries to all of you subscribing already, I have set the feed up so that your
        News reader will automatically find the new feed. I am just posting to get the word
        out.
