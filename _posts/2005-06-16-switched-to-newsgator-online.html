Well I have switched RSS readers.<br />
        <br />
        I had been using <a href="http://bloglines.com">Bloglines</a> for quite a while, but
        it frustrated me in many ways. I had put up with it thinking there was nothing better.<br />
        <br />
        Today I gave <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/ngs/default.aspx">Newsgator Online</a> another
        try and it is looking pretty good. I have switched over to it complety right now.
        <br />
        <br />
        Bloglines is still waiting in case I want to go back, but I am liking Newsgator quite
        a bit.
        <br />
        <br />
        And if you haven't switched to reading the web through RSS, I just found a good article
        that sums up the advantages <a href="http://www.joegrossberg.com/archives/000981.html">here</a>.
