Well it didn't take <a href="http://redune.com/node/515">long</a>. But I've given
        up on <a href="http://newsgator.com/home.aspx">Newsgator</a>. There may have been
        some advantages to it, but Bloglines just is much nicer. The biggest thing is fact
        that in Newsgator to simply unsubscribe from a blog you can't just click on the feed
        in your subscription list and choose unsubscribe (like in Bloglines). You have to
        go to the seperate "Newsgator Manager" in order to make any changes. It doesn't sound
        like a big thing, but is shows the general way of doing things there that is messed
        up.<br />
        <br />
        I've just gotten so used to Bloglines that it is so natural to me.
        <br />
        <br />
        Also, I have a big suspicion that Newsgator wasn't catching all updates. For example,
        the RSS feed for my <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/friends/">Flickr contacts</a> wasn't
        showing nearly all of the photos that have been posted. I am not sure what the reason
        is, but I was missing posts.
        <br />
        <br />
        So I'm back to Bloglines, we'll see how this goes.<br />
