Today I completed <a href="http://jade.bioware.com/">Jade Empire</a>. What a great
        game. I fully enjoyed every moment playing that game. What a great story. Some moments
        moved along pretty slow. Some fights were a little annoying. But all together it was
        quite wonderful. I am missing it right now, I wish that the game kept on going.

        To finish off the night, I loaded up <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289879/">The
        Butterfly Effect</a>. This was an excellent movie. I love movies that make you think
        and this one sure did. I loved the mystery of what will happen next. So many things
        can change so quickly in this movie. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005110/">Ashton
        Kutcher</a> was actually quite good in it, and I wasn't stuck thinking of his character
        in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0165598/">That's 70s Show</a> at all. I recomend
        it highly to anyone who doesn't mind a weird movie, and wants to think a little. <img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=517" />
