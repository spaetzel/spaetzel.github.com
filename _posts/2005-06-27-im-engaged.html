Today I did something wonderful. I proposed to the girl of my dreams. I took her over to Victoria Park in Kitchener and we had a wonderful picnic. At the perfect time, I went down on one knee and pulled out the diamond ring that I bought earlier this month. I asked her, "Laura-Lee, will you marry me?" She was so happy, and told me, "Yes! Of course I'll marry you!". <br />
        <br />
        She has been staring at the shiny ring all afternoon long now. She is so happy. I
        plan to keep making her even happier every day for the rest of our lives.<br />
        <br />
        I love her!<br />
