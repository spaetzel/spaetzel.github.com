Well I had a great week with Laura-Lee last week. She arrived on Friday as my girlfriend and left on Sunday as my <a href="http://redune.com/node/520">fiance</a>.<br />
        <br />
        There were many fun events in between including a birthday party, a great picnic,
        a trip to Stratford and wonderful fireworks.
        <br />
        <br />
        I really cannot wait until I get to see my girl again.<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=521" />
