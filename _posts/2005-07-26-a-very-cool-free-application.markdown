I don't know if any of you have every heard of Konfabulator. It is a very cool app that lets you put cool little widgets up on your desktop.<br />
        <br />
        I currently am using it to show a clock, photos from my flickr contacts, my battery
        life, the westher in Waterloo and my current CPU usage. There are all sorts of other
        widgets that you can download for it as well.<br />
        <br />
        Well, the great people at <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a> went up and bought
        the company that makes <a href="http://www.konfabulator.com">Konfabulator</a>, and
        now the program that used to cost $30 is now free. When I heard the news I pounced
        on it. For the nerdly ones of you out there, I highly recommend that you check it
        out!<br />
