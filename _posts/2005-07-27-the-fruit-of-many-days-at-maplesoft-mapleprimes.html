I want to tell you all about a new Maple Community website that we are developing. beta.mapleprimes.com. MaplePrimes is designed to bring all users of Maple together into a strong community. The site is composed of two major portions: forums and weblogs. <br />
        <br />
        The forums function much like comp.soft-sys.math.maple, where people can post their
        questions and have them answered by the community. The difference is that the MaplePrimes
        forums will be monitored and moderated by Maplesoft selected community members. And
        for questions that the user community cannot answer, Maplesoft developers will be
        there to help as well.<br />
        <br />
        The weblogs allow any user to share their experiences with Maple and Mathematics.
        MaplePrimes provides a place where like minded people can show off their latest findings,
        share Maple procedures or chat about their favorite theorems.
        <br />
        <br />
        Throughout the site many special features are available. The most interesting is the
        ability to post mathematics in 2D notation like you would find in a textbook. It is
        as easy as either entering MathML or the Maple syntax for the math you want to appear.<br />
        <br />
        Overall, we would like MaplePrimes to become the first complete Mathematical portal.
        MaplePrimes should allow anyone with any Math knowledge get help and share what they
        find. We have a number of ideas in development that will add to this.<br />
        <br />
        Please go and check it out at <a href="http://beta.mapleprimes.com"beta.mapleprimes.com</a>.
        I hope that you will find the site to be very useful and come back to visit often.
