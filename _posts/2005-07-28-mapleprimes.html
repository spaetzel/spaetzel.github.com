        Over the last few months at Maplesoft, I have been working on this website called <a href="http://beta.mapleprimes.com">MaplePrimes</a>.
        We are officially launching the site today and I thought that I'd like to share the
        site with readers of redune.com. If you are interested in seeing the development of
        a cool new mathematically focused community, please check it out. Below is the official
        announcement:<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        A new website <a href="http://beta.mapleprimes.com">www.mapleprimes.com</a> has been
        created to offer a moderated community for Maple users to communicate and share techniques
        with each other. The site is sponsored by <a href="http://www.maplesoft.com">Maplesoft</a>,
        though most of the content is expected to be contributed by the user community.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Two of the most significant features of MaplePrimes are moderated forums and weblogs
        (blogs).
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        The <a href="http://beta.mapleprimes.com/forum">forums</a> function much like <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.soft-sys.math.maple">comp.soft-sys.math.maple</a> and
        other public Maple forums, where people can post their questions and have them answered
        by the community. The difference is that the MaplePrimes forums will be monitored
        and moderated by Maplesoft selected community members. And for questions that the
        user community cannot answer, Maplesoft developers will be there to help as well.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        The <a href="http://beta.mapleprimes.com/blog">blogs</a> allow any user to share their
        experiences with Maple and mathematics. MaplePrimes provides a place where like minded
        people can show off their latest findings, share Maple procedures or chat about their
        favorite theorems.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Throughout the site many special features are available. The most interesting is the
        ability to <a href="http://beta.mapleprimes.com/about/posting/mathoverview">post mathematics</a> in
        2D notation like you would find in a textbook. It is as easy as either entering MathML
        or the Maple syntax for the math you want to appear.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Overall, we would like MaplePrimes to become the first complete Mathematical portal.
        MaplePrimes should allow anyone with any Math knowledge get help and share what they
        find. We have a number of ideas in development that will add to this.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Please go and check it out at <a href="http://beta.mapleprimes.com">http://beta.mapleprimes.com</a>.
        I hope that you will find the site to be very useful and come back to visit often.
