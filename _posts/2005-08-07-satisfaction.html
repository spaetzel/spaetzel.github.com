Since the release of PSP <a href="http://psp.ign.com/articles/635/635505p1.html">firmware
        2.0</a>. I had been dreaming of using the now built-in web browser to create a remote
        control for my media playback.<br />
        <br />
        Yesterday, I took my first stab at creating it. And I was remarkably successful. I
        have managed to create a little web page that I can browse to on my PSP and then choose
        any MP3 to start playing. The script will the load up iTunes on my Laptop and play
        it from there. I can also do any of the normal tasks such as Next, Previous, Play,
        Pause.
        <br />
        <br />
        So now, I can have my music blaring throughout the apartment and just keep my PSP
        in my pocket. If I want any changes, I just have to pull it out and click on the right
        link. All very fancy!<br />
