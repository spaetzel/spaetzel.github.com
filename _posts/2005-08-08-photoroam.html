        So today I left work at 5:00 and biked over to St. Jacobs. There I met up with <a href="http://opal.sio2.ca/">Opal</a> who
        let me store my bike in her garage. We then headed to downtown St. Jacobs where we
        met up with the other people who were going to be <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/photoroam">Photoroaming</a> with
        us.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        The people there were: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/spaceamoeba/">SpaceAmoeba </a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jasonshim/">perpetualstroll</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/opal/">Little
        Opal</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tudor/">TheGiantVermin</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/imdreaminggreen/"> pixienicki</a>.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        We all tooks lots of photos which you will be able to see in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/photoroam">the
        group</a>. I sure enjoyed myself as well.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Afterwards, Opal and I biked back to Waterloo and I downloaded my photos. Unfortuately,
        I discovered that I had left my camera set to ISO800 which meant that all of the photos
        are grainy, but most of them are still nice. You can see all of the photos I took
        today, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/redune/sets/722421/">here</a>
