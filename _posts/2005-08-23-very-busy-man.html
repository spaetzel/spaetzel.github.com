        The last few days I have been packing away getting ready to move to London on Saturday.
        I've barely had enough time to stop and relax. The only time that I'm not doing something
        productive is when I'm having my evening chat with Laura-Lee. I sure enjoy that and
        look forward to our talk tonight.<br />

        Last night I headed to Mount Hope Cemetery in Kitchener for my second photoroam with
        a bunch of local Flickr users. It was enjoyable and I got a lot of photos. As <a href="http://opal.sio2.ca/archives/2005/08/photoroam_angel.php">Opal
        Posted</a> the mood was quite different this time from the last. The people weren't
        quite as crazy.

        Hopefully, I'll be able to edit and post my photos soon. But I've been so busy with
        packing that I haven't had nearly enough time. And this thursday, I'll be headed to
        downtown Waterloo with the Photoroamers again to document the Waterloo Busker festival.<br />

        At work today I managed to finish the script that I'd been working on for the last
        few days. I am quite proud of how well it works especially considering how little
        time it took me. It allows you to upload a Maple worksheet to <a href="http://beta.mapleprimes.com">MaplePrimes</a> and
        it spits back an HTML version of the worksheet. So you can then post the HTML anywhere
        in MaplePrimes. It is pretty cool, <a href="http://beta.mapleprimes.com/about/posting/worksheeet">check
        it out.</a>
