I just discovered that UWO has its own weblog that you can find <s>here</s>. And along
        with it is a podcast called <a href="http://atwestern.typepad.com/wi5/">Western in
        Five</a>
        <br />
        <br />
        Very cool. I'm having trouble getting the feed into iTunes though.
        <br />
        <br />
        Update: I've been asked by UWO to remove the link to the Weblog. Apparently it is
        still in development.<br />
