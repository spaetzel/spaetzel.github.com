Well I just got my high speed internet all set up again. Things are looking good and I thnk that the site should be able to stay up without any trouble. (Assuming Sympatico doesn't do anything stupid).<br />
        <br />
        The move went very well. I had a bit of an issue with Uhaul that caused me to instead
        just move using my parent's Minivan and SUV. Turns out that I was able to move almost
        all of my stuff in just those two vehicles. This ended up saving me almost $200, definitely
        a good thing.<br />
        <br />
        Yesterday I finished up cleaning the apartment, it is looking very great now. I am
        looking forward to having Laura-Lee return from her Canoe trip up north. I think that
        she will be very impressed by everything that I have accomplished.<br />
        <br />
        The next step is to finish setting up the network and then I've got to install the
        software that I'll need for school. I also have a huge backlog of photos to edit and
        upload to flickr. We'll see how much of all that stuff I get done today.
