        Well I have been giving a new web browser a whirl over the last day. The brower's
        name is Flock and it is looking pretty cool. It is called a "Social Browser' and it
        has many features that lend itself to what is being called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web
        2.0</a>. These features include <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>, <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weblog">weblogging</a> integration.
        </p>
        <div align="center">
        <p>
        <img src="http://static.flickr.com/25/54686991_390096b6f6_m.jpg" style="border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);" />
        </p>
        </div>
        <p>
        Thus far the browser does seem a bit buggy. I had trouble getting it to post to my <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a> based <a href="http://redune.com">weblog</a>.
        But it looks like the developers are very helpful and answered my question on<a href="http://community.flock.com/node/388"> their
        forums</a> almost immediately.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
        It definitely shows promise. Web users who are intersested in the latest Social web
        technologies should definitely check it out. &nbsp;<br />
