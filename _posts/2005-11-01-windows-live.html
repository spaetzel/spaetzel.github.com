        I just read an <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9886941/" class="T_11_GRY" target="_blank">article</a> on <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9886941/" class="T_11_GRY" target="_blank">MSNBC</a> that
        announces Windows Live, which is found at <a href="http://www.live.com">live.com</a>.
        It is definitely an implementation of <a href="http://start.com">start.com</a> that
        you may have <a href="http://technorati.com/search/start.com">heard about</a> earlier.
        Currently it seems to be a very broken RSS agregator that doesn't work in Firefox
        (or Flock) and not very well in IE either.
        <br />

        Though it certianly makes me wonder why Microsoft is calling the product Windows Live,
        is this the start of something radical from Microsoft that will culminate in Windows
        Vista? We'll have to wait and see.<br />
