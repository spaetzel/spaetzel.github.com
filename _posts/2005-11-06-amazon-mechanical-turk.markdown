        I just signed up for <a href="http://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome">Amazon Mechanical
        Turk</a>. This is a very interesting website that solves a unique problem. It is set
        up so that developers of applications can submit problems that a large amount of intelligence
        to solve. The website then presents these problems to humans and asks them to solve
        the problem. When the person solves the problem they are paid in cash for the solution.
        <br />
        </p>
        <br />
        The only problem that occurs on the site now is a large number of sets of five images.
        It asks you to pick which of the images best shows a certain business. You just pick
        the best image from the list using a radio button and click submit. And just like
        that, you've earned four whole cents! I'm guessing that this data is being used for
        the <a href="http://maps.a9.com/?ypLoc=Geary%20and%20Powell%2C%20San%20Francisco%2C%20CA">A9
        Maps blockview</a> feature.<br />
        <br />
        I might say that the reward is too small right now. Maybe it will increase. It sure
        is a cool idea. I think I may send the link to my Artifical Intelligence prof.<br />
