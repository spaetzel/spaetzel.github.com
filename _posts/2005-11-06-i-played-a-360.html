        Yesterday, LL and I went to Masonville Mall in London, Ontario to do some shopping.
        When I stepped into Electronics Boutique, what did I see but an Xbox 360! Unforutnately
        it was still wrapped up and not plugged in. Apparently they just got it on that day,
        but it would be set up today.

        It won't take you too many guesses to figure out what I did today, I headed over to
        Masonville again and played myself some 360. The kiosk had Kameo, Call of Duty 2 and
        King Kong playable. I was quite impressed by the graphics on all three games and the
        controller is quite sweet. I was thinking of getting Kameo on launch day, but now
        I'll likely wait for the reviews. The control scheme was quite weird, and probably
        will take a lot of getting used to. Call of Duty is beautiful, but I'm not much of
        a WWII game fan so I'm passing on that. King Kong looks interesting, but I had no
        idea what I should be doing in the game so I didn't play for long.<br />
        <br />
        My original Xbox is really starting to die on me. I played Ninja Gaiden today for
        about an hour, the save points are very far apart in that game so I hadn't save for
        a while. Just when I was getting close to being able to save, the Xbox tells me, "Your
        disk may be dirty or damaged" damn! So I lost all of the progress that I made.&nbsp;
        This problem has been hapening a lot ever since I moved back to London. Something
        must have gotten jostled inside of the Xbox that screwed up the DVD drive.<br />
        <br />
        I really hope that the 360 will be backwards compatable with most of my Xbox games.
        I look forward to when Microsoft finally announces which games will work. That way
        I can just trade in my Xbox and play all of my games on my brand new Xbox 360.<br />
        <br />
        I sure am looking forward to November 22!<br />
