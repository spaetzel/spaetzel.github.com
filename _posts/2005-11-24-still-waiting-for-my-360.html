So on tuesday (Xbox 360 launch day) I got up at 5:30 AM and so that I could head to the Futureshop in North London and hopefully pick up a 360 without a preorder. I arrived at about 6:50 and there were about 30 people standing in line ahead of me. A manager from Futureshop came out at 7:15 and asked the people who had preorders to move to a seperate section. About 8 of the people ahead of me joined that group.<br />
        <br />
        One of them even had the balls to walk back and offer to sell his, bids starting at
        $570. Apparently he has preorders all over the province and expected to make a big
        profit. It may work out for him, but it pisses me off. I want to buy one Xbox and
        he is hoarding a bunch for himself.
        <br />
        <br />
        I wish that Microsoft had've focused on building only the Premium bundle. How many
        hardcore gamers who buy on launch day would want to save $100 and get the core bundle?
        The core is a bad idea, since just buying the hard drive as an accessory costs $100,
        and to save games you'll have to either buy the HD or a memory card.
        <br />
        <br />
        So the futurehop guy came out fifteen minutes later and annouced that they have 15
        Xbox 360s all of which are the core bundle. I knew the core wouldn't do it for me,
        so I went home.<br />
        <br />
        So here I am now, with PGR3 and Kameo for the Xbox 360 collecting dust in my apartment
        without a console to play them on. Hopefully EB will get their second shipment soon
        so that I can get on with my gaming!<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=555" />
