So yesterday, EB games gave me a call at about 1:30 PM. My 360 had arrived!<br />
        <br />
        So I quicly packed up all of my original Xbox stuff (So I could trade it in) and got
        on the bus to the mall. It seemed like the transfer for my 2nd bus took forever. But
        eventually I made it there.<br />
        <br />
        I managed to get $116 of trade in credit for all of my Xbox stuff. So I picked up
        My Xbox 360, A Wireless Controller and the S-Video Cable. The grand total was about
        $505. I already had PGR3 and Kameo waiting to be played.<br />
        <br />
        The system is just great. I love playing with everything on the system. Everything
        works perfectly, and I haven't had a single problem with the machine.<br />
        <br />
        Too bad that I've got an exam on Thurdsay, becuase I just want to play on my 360...<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=556" />
