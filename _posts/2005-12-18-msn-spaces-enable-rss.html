        I have a number of friends who have weblogs which are located on MSN Spaces. Lots
        of the time they have interesting things to say which I am interested in hearing about.
        Unfortunately, most of these blogs do not have RSS enabled.&nbsp; Many of you may
        not know what RSS is, so I wrote up a brief description of RSS <a href="http://redune.com/about/rss">here</a>.
        In short it is a technology that lets me read a large number of weblogs all in one
        location without having to manually go visit each of these sites individually.
        </p>
        <p>
        To anyone using MSN spaces, please enable RSS! Here's how to do it:
        </p>
        <ol>
        <li>
        First, go to your Space and make sure that you are logged in.
        </li>
        <li>
        Next, click on settings near the top right hand side of your space</li>
        <li>
        Now, click on permissions at near the top middle of the page</li>
        <li>
        Set your permissions to public and click on Save at the bottom of the page<br />
        </li>
        <li>
        Click on Settings again in the top right</li>
        <li>
        Scroll to the bottom of the settings page and check the box next to Syndicate.</li>
        <li>
        Click Save</li>
        </ol>
        That is all that there is to it. Now I, and anyone else who uses RSS that comes across
        your weblog will be able to easily keep up to date on all of your posts.
