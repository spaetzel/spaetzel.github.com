I was reading <a href="http://onlyinevitable.blogspot.com/2005/12/geen-beats-bush.html">this
        blog post</a> and saw that she noticed that the word <a href="http://technorati.com/search/saugeen">Saugeen</a> topped <a href="http://technorati.com/search/bush">Bush</a> as
        a popular search on <a href="http://technorati.com">Technorati</a>. I headed over
        to technorati myself and saw this:<br />
        <br />
        <a href="http://redune.com/system/files?file=technorati-uwo_l.jpg"><img src="http://redune.com/system/files?file=technorati-uwo_m.jpg"></a>
        <br />
        <a href="http://technorati.com/search/university%20of%20western%20ontario">The University
        Of Western Ontario</a> is the #7 search this hour on Technorati. Wow, this Saugeen
        Stripper thing it getting worldwide attention now. There have been news articles in
        the <a href="http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1134427836448&call_pageid=968332188492&col=968793972154">Toronto
        Star</a> and the Toronto Sun, and now posts are appearing in blogs that have nothing
        to do with UWO. Myself, I attend Western and have spent a lot of time in Saugeen.
        I certainly am not surprised at all that something like this occured in that residence.
        And if people want to take their clothes off and have photos shared worldwide, I say
        go ahead, do what you want. If you haven't seen the photos yet, they are <a href="http://avrilrulez.buzznet.com/user/archive/">here </a> <strong>NSFW</strong>.<br />
