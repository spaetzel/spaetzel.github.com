Well, I was getting fed up with the unreliablility of redune.com. The server seemed to be taking down my DSL connection regularly, and it looked like the server couldn't handle the amount of traffic that was going through it.<br />
        <br />
        I was looking at renewing a domain name that was about to expire when I saw that GoDaddy.com
        offers web hosting at less than $5.00 a month. This seemed like too good of an offer
        to pass up.<br />
        <br />
        So I signed up and tested the service out. It looks quite good. With the basic, economy
        package I get 5GB of storage, and 500GB of transfer per month! And I am able to use
        MySQL and PHP pages as much as I want.
        <br />
        <br />
        This should mean that Redune will be much more reliable in the future, which definitly
        is a plus for both myself and my readers.<br />
        <br />
        If you have any issues with the server, please let me know.<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=570" />
