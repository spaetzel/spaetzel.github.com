If you know about the story of the Millions of Atari 2600 cartriges that are buried under a New Mexico desert, you've got to check out this <a href="http://keithschofield.com/et/">music
        video</a>.<br />
        <br />
        The story goes like this, Atari got the rights to create a video game based on E.T.
        and they wanted the game out in time for christmas. They had to rush to get the game
        done and the end result was terrible. Nearly every game that was purchased was returned
        to the store. And they actually manufactured more cartridges than consoles that had
        ever been sold, they hoped the game would help sell systems.<br />
        <br />
        They ended up with millions of cartridges that they couldn't get rid of. This music
        video is the story of guys that go looking for the cartridges.
