I just discovered <a href="http://randomchaos.com/games/fastr/">this</a> cool game.
        It shows a bunch of photos taken from <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> and asks
        you to guess what the common tag is between them all.
        <br />
        <br />
        It shows your scores against a bunch of other people. You are competing to be the
        fastest flickr guesser.<br />
