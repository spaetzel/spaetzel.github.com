        new version, 0.5.11 and it is looking a lot better than the previous versions.&nbsp;
        I think that I may actually be able to make it my primary browser now.

        &nbsp;It does look like it will make a great, Web 2.0 browser. It has integrated Blogging,
        Social Bookmarking and Photo Sharing capabilites. I will report back with more after
        I've given it a whirl for a while.
