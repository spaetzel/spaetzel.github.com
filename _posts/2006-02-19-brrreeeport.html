I am posting this to test out this Blog Meme that&nbsp; <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/Scobleizer%20-%20Microsoft%20Geek%20Blogger">Robert
        Scoble</a> created. He expains it all in his original <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/02/13/blogcode-helps-you-find-blogs-similar-to/" rel="bookmark">blog
        post</a>. Basically, he is suggesting that every blogger should post an entry containing
        the word, brrreeeport, and then they will appear in the top rankings for <a href="http://www.technorati.com/search/brrreeeport">this
        Technorati results page</a>. This is similar to the effect that I noticed when I <a href="http://redune.com/node/557
        University of Western Ontario tops on Technorati (Saugeen Stripper) - Redune">Blogged
        about the Saugeen Stripper</a>. That post has had almost 4000 people read it. Which
        is waaay more reads than I would get for a typical post on Redune. I'm curious to
        see how far this will go, time to post and watch it go!<img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=594" />
