I switched hosting companies again. This time, away from GoDaddy and over to <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?156108">Dreamhost</a>.
        When I switched, my <a href="http://redune.com/code/phpgamercard">Gamercard script</a> caused
        problems forcing my SQL database to reach 60 GB!!! This caused just a few problems
        causing me to take the site offline until the problems had been resolved. It looks
        like I now have everything under control, and the wonderful Dreamhost goodness is
        well under way. If you want to see why I've switched, you should check out <a href="http://blendblogs.com">Blendblogs</a>,
        which is the website I'm building for my thesis. <a href="http://blendblogs.com/inviterequest.php">Sign
