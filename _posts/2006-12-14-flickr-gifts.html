        Click on this photo to see a new feature that Flickr has added. If you add a tag to
        any photo with the text "ho ho ho hat" or "ho ho ho beard" you'll get images that
        you can add to the image. Silly, but kind of fun. You can even do it to other people's
        pictures, if they allow you to add notes.<br />
        <br />
        Also, the other big news is that Flickr is now allowing pro users to upload unlimited
        amounts of photos a month. Previously, we were restricted to only uploading 2GB. I'm
        definitely going to be uploading every single one of my photos for backup. This will
        definitely help reduce the worry of losing my precious digital photos.
