If this is your first time here, you won't find anything new. But for old visitors of Spaetzel.com or Redune.com, you'll see that the site is now quite different.<br />
        <br />
        I have replaced Redune.com with Spaetzel.com, I wish to make it easier for people
        to find me on the web, and what better way to do that than using my name. My photography
        business is not likely to go anywhere in the near future, but the site is still there
        at <a href="http://photos.spaetzel.com">photo.spaetzel.com</a>. I hope that you like
        this new design. I think that it is nice and simple, and does a good job of showing
        off everything that I am doing on the web.<br />
        <br />
        I have also set up a new RSS feed at <a href="http://spaetzel.com/feed">spaetzel.com/feed</a> that
        combines my latest posts here, my latest <a href="http://twitter.com/spaetzel">Twitter</a> updates,
        and my latest Flickr photos. This feed is special in that it combines my flickr photos
        into only one entry per day. That way when I upload lots of photos, my feed won't
        be bombarded by Flickr photos.<br />
        <br />
        I hope you like the site, please send me your comments, I look forward to hearing
        from you. <img width="0" height="0" src="http://spaetzel.com/aggbug.ashx?id=600" />
