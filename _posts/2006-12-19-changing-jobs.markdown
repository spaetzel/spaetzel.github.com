        So last thursday an e-mail was sent around to Maplesoft employees that a person was
        leaving the BIS group at Maplesoft, leaving a vacancy in that group. Since I am very
        intersted in doing more development work, rather than doing Marketing I was very interested
        in this job, so I applied for it. After having a quick meeting with the BIS manager
        and his boss, I found out the next day that I got the job. So, starting on Jan 8,
        2007 I will be switching jobs at Maplesoft. I am very excited about this change, I
        think that I will really enjoy the work that I will be doing there.

        Since I am leaving Market Development, there is now a job posting up for my old job.
        Here is the job description:
        </p>
        <br />
        <blockquote>
        <p>
        This is a unique position suited for engineering and scientific professionals seeking
        careers that have both technical and marketing elements. The Market Development group
        at Maplesoft is responsible for a wide range of technical marketing activities including
        demonstration application development, technical marketing content creation, user
        presentations and demonstrations, user-base development, product management, and product
        launches. The core of the department are technical people who can seamlessly work
        in either a technical or marketing context.
        </p>
        <p>
        <br />
        <br />
        As a marketing engineer, you will be responsible for creating compelling demonstrations,
        articles, and other communication tools to illustrate the benefits of our sophisticated
        product line to our customers. Ideally, you have a degree in engineering or science,
        and have first-hand experience in marketing or sales. Your written and oral communication
        skills are exceptional and you have a passion and talent for communicating in an engaging
        way. You thrive in the rapid change-driven environment of a creative group and you
        excel at effectively navigating uncharted waters. Finally, your strong people, leadership,
        and communication skills are complemented by technical depth and experience in one
        of the primary engineering or applied science fields. Specific backgrounds in mechanical
        design, electronics and signal processing, or financial mathematics are strong assets.
        Five years experience is highly desirable but we encourage those with less experience
        and new graduates to apply.
        </p>

        things up for you.
        </p>
