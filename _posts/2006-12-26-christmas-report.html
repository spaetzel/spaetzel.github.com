        I have already <a href="http://spaetzel.com/node/604">posted</a>, I am currently spending
        my&nbsp;time in Timmins, Ontario with my Fiance's family. Since today is Boxing day,
        I thought I would give you a report on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.

        On Sunday (Christmas Eve) we started the day by going to church. The service was led
        by the same woman who we expect to be marrying Laura-Lee and I in august. We will
        be meeting with her tomorrow to discuss the wedding.

        That evening we enjoyed an excellent prime rib roast. We then cleaned up after Christmas
        and stepped into the Living room to spend some time with the Christmas tree. Laura-Lee
        distributed gifts to everyone and we all tore into opening everything up.&nbsp;This
        was an unusual experience for me, as I am used to having one person open one gift
        at a time. Is it so much more&nbsp;chaotic doing it this way; but it is what they
        are used to and I enjoyed the experience just as well. The&nbsp;Firlotte's bought
        me a great wine rack that has room for six bottles of wine and holders for eight wine
        glasses. Heide even painted me a sign that says "Welcome to my&nbsp;Wine Cellar".
        It was a very thoughtful gift and I look forward to setting it up at home. I'll certainly
        be taking a photo of it and posting it here&nbsp;as soon as I get home.

        The next day was of course Christmas Day. We had a nice lazy day which didn't get
        started until 11:30. Laura-Lee started the afternoon by preparing the Christmas turkey
        and all of the sides. She then settled down for a long winter's nap. I then attempted
        to take over the world with LL's brother, Spencer and her dad, Daryl. Spencer was
        the one who ended up winning the game of Risk, but I certainly still did enjoy myself.

        That evening most of the Firlotte's extended family that lives in Timmins came over
        for dinner. We ended up having ten people all sitting around the table. The dinner
        that Laura-Lee prepared was excellent. However, my favorite part was the great cheese
        cake that Laura-Lee prepared. This was the same one that she made for the Christmas
        party that we had with our friends back in London. She'll definitely have to keep
        that recipe around as we both love it.

        Overall, Christmas in Timmins was a great experience. I was very glad to have been
        able to spend the time with Laura-Lee and her family. I hope that everyone else reading
        this had as good of a Christmas as I did. Merry Christmas to all, and happy new year!
