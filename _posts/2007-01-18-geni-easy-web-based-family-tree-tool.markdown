I just started building my family tree up using a tool called <a href="http://geni.com">Geni</a>.
        This is a flash based application that makes it easy to build up your tree. I think
        that this may actually be useful to help Laura-Lee and I get a better picture on each
        other's families. As with everybody, we have lots of family to get our heads around,
        and coming up on our wedding date, it would be nice to know just how everybody that
        is going to be there is related.<br />
