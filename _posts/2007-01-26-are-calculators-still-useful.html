        <a href="http://scientificcomputing.blogspot.com">Scientific Computing</a> recently <a href="http://scientificcomputing.blogspot.com/2006/01/whats-point-of-calculators.html">posted
        their thoughts</a> on the usefulness of scientific calculators. They also had an interview
        with a representative of Texas Instruments. When the rep was asked the question of
        "why would I still use a calculator now that computers are so cheap?"
        </p>
        <p>
        The final explanation, and the only one that Scientific Computing was satisfied with
        was that for a calculator, "you can take it into an exam, but most exam systems do
        not allow you to bring a computer in."
        </p>
        <p>
        For myself, I haven't touched a calculator in quite a while. For simple problems,
        I will just use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Calculator">Windows
        Calculator</a>, or <a href="http://www.google.com/help/calculator.html">Google</a>.
        And of course, for anything else, I use Maple.
        </p>
        <p>
        I spent a lot of time using a <a href="http://education.ti.com/educationportal/sites/US/productDetail/us_ti83p.html">TI-83</a> which
        definitely made life a lot easier for me. However, once I discovered the usefulness
        of doing mathematics on the computer I quickly abandoned the calculator.

        There is a <a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/01/25/0611218">post
        on Slashdot</a> that asks what is the best graphing calculator. In this discussion,
        several of the commenter's suggest using Maple instead.
        </p>
        <p>
        So I am posing the question, how many of you still use calculators? If you don't have
        to worry about where you can take a computer, would you choose to use a calculator,
        or would you rather do your math on your computer?
