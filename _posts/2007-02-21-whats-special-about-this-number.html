        I just found <a href="http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/numbers.html">this site</a> over
        on <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/93924389/whats_special_a.html">O'Reilly
        Radar</a>. It lists the numbers 0 to 9999 and describes mathematical properties for
        that number. Here are the first few numbers to give you an idea of what is there:
        </p>
