        I just came across <a href="http://www.pvponline.com/article/3255/tue-apr-10">this
        comic</a> by <a href="http://www.pvponline.com">PvP</a>. Normally I find this comic
        quite hilarious, and this one is funny. However it does make me want to get out and
        do something as well.

        I'll at least crack out my D70 and head out on the town.
