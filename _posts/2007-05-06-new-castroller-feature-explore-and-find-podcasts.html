        <a href="http://castroller.com/explore"><img src="http://castroller.com/images/findpodcasts.png" align="right" border="0"></a> Last
        week, we published a new feature to <a href="http://castroller.com">CastRoller</a>,
        the explore page. This is a page on <a href="http://castroller.com">CastRoller</a> that
        contains many features that help you to find new podcasts to listen and subscribe
        to on <a href="http://castroller.com">CastRoller</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        First, there is a list of categories. You can click on each of the categories to find
        podcasts that are related to that category. If you find any podcasts that you think
        belong in these categories, just use the category name to tag the podcast; that podcast
        will then appear in the category.
        </p>
        <p>
        Next, is&nbsp;a feature everyone saw coming, the <a href="http://castroller.com/top">most
        popular podcasts</a> on <a href="http://castroller.com">CastRoller</a>. This is a
        list of the podcasts that have the most subscribers on <a href="http://castroller.com">CastRoller</a>.
        This is a good way to see what is popular with everyone. You can even keep up to date
        with this list by subscribing to <a href="http://castroller.com/top/feed">its feed.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
        <a title="Photo Sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/redune/487207588/"><img height="180" alt="mydesktop" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/191/487207588_7af58fe9b5_m.jpg" width="240" align="left" border="0"></a>In
        addition to the top podcasts, there is a list of random users of <a href="http://castroller.com">CastRoller</a>.
        You can click on any of these people's names to see what podcasts they have subscribed
        to and how they have tagged them. You may find someone with similar interests to yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
        Lastly, is a cool new feature that may not be too useful, but it is quite cool, <a href="http://castroller.com/explore/logos/">Explore
        by Podcast logos</a>. This feature displays a selection of random podcast logos on
        one page. At a glance, you can see the logos for many different podcasts. Click on
        a logo that interests you and you might find a podcast that you will love.
        </p>
        <p>
        Also, as you can see in the screenshot on the left, you can set the podcast logos
        to be your wallpaper. <a href="http://castroller.com/help/logopaper">Click here to
        read</a> about how you can do that. It just takes a few clicks, and you will then
        have a constantly updated desktop wallpaper full of cool new podcasts for you to discover
        and enjoy.
