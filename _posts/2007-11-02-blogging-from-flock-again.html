So I am giving the <a href="http://flock.com">Flock</a> web browser another try. I
        have installed it several times in the past, usually I end up giving up on it because
        it is too unstable, but I still wish I could keep using it. I love its integration
        with all of the social aspects of the web.<br />
        <br />
        They just released Flock 1.0, so I figured it is time to give it another whirl. It
        is looking even better that I remember. I really like the People sidebar that shows
        what everyone on all of my social websites are up to at a glance. Also the "My World"
        homepage looks great.<br />
        <br />
        Unfortunately, the whole experience thus far has been really slow, it feels like Flock
        is really bogged down by all of its extra features (It is based on Firefox). We'll
        see if the slowness is something that I can deal with. More details coming soon.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Update: After playing around with Flock, the slowness annoyed me too much to continue.
        Perhaps by Flock 2.0, they'll figure out that a laggy browser just isn't acceptable.<br />
