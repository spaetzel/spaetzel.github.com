I am currently working on creating a new version of <a href="http://castroller.com">CastRoller</a>,
        and am developing this version in .NET. Because of this, I needed to find a new webhost
        that supports Windows Hosting.<br />
        <br />
        Since I don't really want to pay two companies for hosting, I needed to move Spaetzel.com
        over as well, I figured this is a good time to try out a new blogging platform, since
        PHP hosting on IIS, doesn't work nearly as seamlessly as .NET.<br />
        <br />
        So I am now using DasBlog as my blogging platform. It seems to have a very robust
        API that should allow me to do some interesting this with this blog.
        <br />
        <br />
        Note: Right now any older entries that have comments on them won't load. I'm trying
        to figure out what exactly the problem is there.<br />
        <br />
        I'll be creating a new theme and moving everything that you are used to from the old
        site back over here soon.<br />
