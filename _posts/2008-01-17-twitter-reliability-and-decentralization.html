        As you may know, I am a big fan of <a href="http://twitter.com/spaetzel">Twitter</a>.
        Recently, during Steve Jobs' Macworld keynote, many Twitter users wanted to share
        their thoughts on the keynote as it happened, unfortunately, Twitter was unavailable
        for most of the time that Steve was on the stage and for much of the afternoon following.
        This is not unusual for Twitter, their servers seem unable to cope with the stress
        of high volume events. Of course, developing any website to handle this stress is
        difficult, so I cannot fault them. The problem is that the community is locked into
        using the same site for all of our Microblogging. It is possible that everyone would
        switch to another service such as <a href="http://pownce.com/spaetzel/">Pownce</a>,
        but as with Twitter, there is no guarantee that the new site would be any more reliable.
        </p>
        <p>
        Russell Beattie posted a good idea, <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/blog/decentralized-twitter-thoughts">using
        instant messaging clients</a> as our Microblogging system. He suggested that we have
        a bot on our IM list that automatically repeats to our full IM list, all messages
        we send to it. There could be multiple services that offer bots that do this, and
        if they all support a <a href="http://www.jabber.org/">common IM protocol</a>, there
        is nothing stopping us all from using different bots.
        </p>
        <p>
        This would solve the problem of having all of the conversations muted, when one service
        goes down. True, if one bot goes down, its users would be silenced, but they could
        move onto another service quite easily.
        </p>
        <p>
        Now, we have to see if anyone will implement this as a solution to the problem.
