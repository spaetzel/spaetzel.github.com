<p>
        Back in January, I switched this blog to run off of <a href="http://www.dasblog.info/">DasBlog</a>,
        switching away from the old <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> based site. And
        of course, my old theme style didn't work any more. Since that time, I've been using
        one of the default DasBlog themes, which, to put it frankly, was ugly. I just finally
        uploaded the new theme that I had been working on for the last couple of weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
        The two goals of the theme were to make the site easy to use, and to show new visitors
        who I am and what I do. There are several new features that you'll find with this
        version.
        </p>
        <p>
        The first, and most visible additions are my phone number and e-mail address front
        and centre. I want to remove any barriers to people contacting me, so I put those
        two pieces of information where they would be found right away. They are both in an
        image, so spammers shouldn't be able to contact me. And the number is my Grand Central
        number, which lets me filter callers if necessary, right now it will ring my phones
        directly.
        </p>
        <p>
        Next, is the new about me section up at the top. There is both a "Twitter Style" quick
        blurb, and for those who want to know more, a new <a href="http://spaetzel.com/About.aspx">About
        Me page</a> that should satisfy all but the most curious of visitors.
        </p>
        <p>
        I've added the obligatory list of social networks - all coded directly in HTML, I
        want to avoid any JavaScript includes as they slow down your browser and don't always
        look so nice.
        </p>
        <p>
        The other big addition is my Tumblelog, which I have set up to pull in almost everything
        that I do on the web including my <a href="http://www.twitter.com/spaetzel">Twitter
        posts</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/redune">Flickr photos</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/09880134018427269230">Google
        Reader Shared Items</a>, and my <a href="http://del.icio.us/redune">del.icio.us bookmarks</a>.
        I don't expect many people to do this, but you can <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/spaetzel/tumblelog">subscribe
        to the feed</a> if you want to see everything I do on the web.
        </p>

        I hope that you like the update. Please post what you think of it in the comments.
        Now, to get to actually posting something to read around here.
