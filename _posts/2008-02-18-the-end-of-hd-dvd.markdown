        news has been all over the net that Toshiba is finally throwing in the towel for HD-DVD.
        This isn't a terrible surprise given the number of studios that have jumped ship in
        2008, and the cancellation of their CES press conference.

        Personally, I was backing HD-DVD, yes I am an Xbox and Microsoft guy, so I am biased;
        but, the HD-DVD spec was always much more laid out. The features that HD-DVD had that
        Blu-ray didn't were the requirement for a hard drive or flash drive to store updates
        on, and an Ethernet connection allowing firmware updates and access to online content.
        </p>

        Both of those features really excited the Nerd within me. The idea of a DVD that isn't
        static and can be updated as new content becomes available was really amazing to me.
        Blu-ray has struggled with comparability since its inception. There were several movies
        that didn't work on all players, and the PS3, with its hard drive and net connection
        was always the only player that could always play all discs. There are rumours that
        the Blu-ray spec is changing, making the Hard drive and net connection a requirement.
        But, since it wasn't always required from the start, these features won't be widely
        used be the discs.

        However, I certainly am very glad that the world is moving towards a single format.
        This certainly will hasten the price drop of the technology, and help ensure that
        your Hi Def disc collection won't be suddenly a pile of useless plastic. The issue
        now is if people will bother upgrading at all, DVDs look quite good on most HD screens.
        HD content does look better, but I doubt that the general public really cares about
        having the best quality possible. DVD had lots of benefits over VHS, over and above
        the picture quality, so it was an easy change to argue for. HD movies, are not as
        easy to argue.
        </p>
        <p>
        Personally, I think that downloadable content will be the winner. There are no stores
        that make the argument easy that are around these days, too few people have Set top
        boxes that can download content. And the boxes that people do have, only allow you
        to rent HD movies, not buy. Once purchasing becomes available, and people have set
        top boxes, like the Xbox 360 or Apple TV, I really think that the convenience of getting
        movies instantly, and having all of your purchases readily available to you will be
        an argument that is hard to pass up.

        Only time will tell to see what truly comes out on top. But one thing is abundantly
        clear. HD-DVD is definitely not the winner here.
