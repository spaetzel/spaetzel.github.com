I just downloaded the new <a href="http://www.flock.com/node/61210">Flock 1.1 Beta</a> and
        thus far it looks pretty good. In the past, every time that I install Flock, I find
        that the browser is horribly slow, making it unrealistic to use as my everyday browser.
        But this time, it looks like they got it right. It doesn't seem to be any slower than
        Firefox. Now, I think the only complaint I have is that the People bar listing for
        Twitter is pretty much useless because it doesn't update often enough, and people's
        tweets are cut off, so I have to go to Twitter.com to see the whole post. I'll post
        more detailed impressions shortly.<br />
