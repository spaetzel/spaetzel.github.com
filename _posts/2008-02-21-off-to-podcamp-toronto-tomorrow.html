        I will be headed to&#160; Toronto to take part in <a href="http://podcamptoronto.pbwiki.com/">Podcamp
        Toronto 2008</a>. I am really excited for this event as I will be able to see lots
        of the people that I met last year at <a href="http://spaetzel.com/2007/05/02/PodcastersAcrossBorders.aspx">Podcasters
        Across Borders</a> and also meet lots of people that I've been interacting with online
        over the last year.
        </p>
        <p>
        I'll be leaving along with my wife, Laura-Lee at noon to spend the afternoon at the <a href="http://www.autoshow.ca/2008/">Canadian
        International Autoshow</a> and then will be heading to the <a href="http://podcamptoronto.pbwiki.com/Podcamp+Toronto+2008+-+Evening+Meetups">Tweet
        Up</a>&#160; at the Bier Market in the evening. To many of my readers, I'll see you
        there.
        </p>
        <p>
        I should be posting lots of photos to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/redune">Flickr</a> over
        the weekend, and might even blog a couple of times over the weekend.
