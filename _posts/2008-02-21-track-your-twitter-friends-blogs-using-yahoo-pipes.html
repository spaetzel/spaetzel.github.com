        a cool Yahoo Pipe that I just finished building. It loops trough all of your Twitter
        friends, loads up their blogs and then returns the latest items from their blog's
        RSS feed.
        </p>
        <p>
        Essentially this allows you to subscribe to all of your Twitter friend's blogs without
        actually adding all of their feeds to your reader. Just add the feed for this pipe: <a title="http://pipes.yahoo.com/spaetzel/twitterfriends" href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/spaetzel/twitterfriends">http://pipes.yahoo.com/spaetzel/twitterfriends</a>
        </p>
        <p>
        It does take a long time to run the first time, but the results are very useful.
        </p>

        I have been spending a lot of time playing with Yahoo Pipes, you can see some more
        pipes that I have created here: <a title="http://pipes.yahoo.com/spaetzel/" href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/spaetzel/">http://pipes.yahoo.com/spaetzel/</a>.
        I'll blog about more of them soon.
