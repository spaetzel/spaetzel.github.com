<p>With today's <a href="http://blog.aiderss.com/2008/07/10/aiderss-launches-postrankcom-and-thematic-postrank%e2%84%a2/">announcements</a> of the updated PostRank API and <a href="http://postrank.com">PostRank.com</a>, I felt that it was time that I finish up and release the .NET PostRank Library that built for CastRoller.</p>  <p>The library is a simple wrapper for all of the PostRank API calls. Usage is pretty simple, and I've included a sample program to get you started.</p>  <p>I've released it under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License</a> meaning that anyone is free to reuse and modify the code, as long as the attribute me as the original author.</p>  <p><a href="http://spaetzel.com/postranksharp/">Read more</a>    <br /><a href="http://spaetzel.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/postranksharp10.zip">Download Version 1.0</a></p>
