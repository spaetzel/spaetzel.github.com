<p>A friend of mine from high school, <a href="http://trevoro.ca/blog/">Trevor Orsztynowicz</a> wrote to his MP in Vancouver regarding bill C-61. She send back an excellent reply that show that she understands the issues completely:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>This Bill does not serve either consumer or creator well.&#160; It prescribes narrow, punitive solutions to a complex problem.&#160; In fact the Bill could well have the effect of curbing the use of digital technology, to the extent that it becomes useless. This would be a pity!&#160; As well implementation of the measures in the Bill would be nearly impossible, unless one abandons all privacy rights or imposes locks on the digital technology that severely limits its application.&#160; How to monetize digital technology to reward the creator and allow free and open use by the consumer is challenging</p> </blockquote>  <p><a href="http://trevoro.ca/blog/2008/07/17/mp-response-to-bill-c-61/">Read the rest of her letter on his blog</a></p>
