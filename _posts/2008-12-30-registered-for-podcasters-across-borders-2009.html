I just posted on the <a href="http://blog.castroller.com/2008/12/castroller-will-be-at-podcasters-across-borders-2009/">CastRoller blog</a> that I will be at <a class="zem_slink" title="Podcasters Across Borders" rel="homepage" href="http://podcastersacrossborders.com">Podcasters Across Borders</a> this year. I wan't able to attend last year, so I am really looking forward to the event this time around.

When I attended for the first time in 2007, I only knew one person there: <a title="Bill Deys" rel="facebook" href="http://deys.ca">Bill Deys</a>, and it took me a while to get to know other people there. I had a great time at <a href="http://podcamptoronto.pbwiki.com/">Podcamp Toronto</a> last year, knowing a good number of people before hand really helped me to have a good time.  The community is very welcoming, I'm just a person that takes a while to feel comfortable with people.So now that I know a bunch of people there, I know that I'll have a great time.

Today and tomorrow are the last days you can get the early registration price for PAB, so if you aren't signed up yet, you should <a href="http://www.podcastersacrossborders.com/registration-form/?em_action=register_form&amp;event_id=5">go and register</a>. And while you are at it register for <a href="http://podcamplondon-spaetzel.eventbrite.com/">Podcamp London</a> as well!
