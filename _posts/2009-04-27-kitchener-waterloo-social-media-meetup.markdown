I have been attending the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/LondonSocialMedia/">London Blogger/Podcaster Geek Dinner</a> for over two years now and have always had an excellent time at the meetups. There is always great conversations and I've made a number of close friends from the people that I've met there. </p>  <p><div style="font-size: 12px; float: right; width: 214px; font-family: tahoma, verdana, sans serif; text-align: center"><embed src="http://www.meetup.com/swf/membership_badge.swf?chapterid=1444348" width="214" height="142" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer"></embed>    <br /><a href="http://blog.meetup.com/442/?track=i3/mu_ht8anwt8vb">Click here to check out     <br />The Kitchener-Waterloo Social Media Meetup!</a></div>Since I live in Kitchener, I'd like to start a simliar group in the KW area. There are a number of Tweetups and other various meetups that have happened in the past, but the big difference is that none of them have had a recurring schedule.</p>  <p>So I have created the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/KW-SocialMedia/">Kitchener-Waterloo Social Media Meetup</a>. We will meet on the third Wednesday of every month. The first meetup is on May 20, 2009 at 7:30 PM at Symposium in downtown Waterloo.</p>  <p>If you are interested in social media, be it blogging, podcasting, Facebook, <a href="http://twitter.com/spaetzel" target="_blank">Twitter</a> or anything else. I hope to see you there!</p>
