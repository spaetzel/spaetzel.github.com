Iam at the meetup

Tonight is the [first meetup](http://www.meetup.com/KW-SocialMedia/calendar/10276730) from the [Social Media Meetup Group](http://www.meetup.com/KW-SocialMedia/)
that I started in the Kitchener-Waterloo area.

My reasons for starting the event are simple, I've always had a great time at the [London Geek Dinner](http://www.meetup.com/LondonSocialMedia/) 
and wanted to attend an even like it more often, and to avoid having to drive to London to get there! 
The other reason is to help grow the KW Social Media scene. I've found many [kw bloggers](http://delicious.com/redune/kw) 
and [Twitterers](http://delicious.com/redune/kwtwitter) but have met very few of them. This event will be 
a great way to get a bunch of them in a room together and finally be able to put a face (bigger than a profile picture) to the Twitter name.

I expect this event to grow just as the London event did. The advantage of this event over others in the area
is that we are the first to have a regular schedule. We'll always be meeting on the third wednesday of the month.

[See you there!](http://www.meetup.com/KW-SocialMedia/calendar/10276730)
