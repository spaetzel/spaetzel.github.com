I continued my unbroken attendance to StartupCampWaterloo tonight. As alsways, it was a great turnout. It seems like a younger croud with less familiar faces than normal, but still a good crew. 

The evening started with people giving their first pitches, hoping to get a turn to present. Here were the pictches:

[Ultrasaur RM](ultrasaur.us)
===
The first demo, Ultrasaur is a service to audit changes made to files on a computer. The pitch is protecting companies against crooked system administrators. 

It works by storing the "fingerprint" of files on Ultrasaur's web servers. There is an application that runs daily and uploads the fingerprints for all tracked files on the computer. They alieve concerns that the app might be working maliciously by providing the source code of the app to their customers. 



Web interface shows alerts for changes to files. Source of the client software is available to audit. Not able to track who made the change.

First impression is that is looks a lot like [Google Wave](http://wave.google.com). They plan to take advantage of the Wave API. You can put up links and have comments from your 
collaborators on the links. Shows thumbnails (from websnapr/mister-wong.com). 

Want a Fremium model. Premium accounts could have export or file uploading. Apparently looks like Brainpark, also similar to Primar Fusion.

[NeverBored Studios](http://neverboredstudios.com/)
===
iPhone game, ThreadBound. Side scroller/puzzle. Trying to find ways to market app. 


[Kaimera Media Inc.](kaimeramedia.com)
===
Instant Video, Instant Memories. Used to work at the National Film Board. Partnered with IBM Canada. IBM has built Kiosks. Software captures video such as a roller coaster ride and then burns a CD. The CD has other content and links for more things to buy. Such as a link to buy more tickets to the park.

Closed alpha. "thought networking" 
- What are you thinking about? - 
- collect thoughts and content about this subject
- Act upon your thoughts: - Create a website - create a document - create an RSS feed

You enter a topic, it looks for related topics automatically. Can grab photos, news, pages etc based on tags.

Can generate a website automatically based on the things you chose to include in your "thought network"

Can sign up now - need to wait to be approved.

In the future they  want to create agents that work automatically. Such as automatic searching or automatic shopping bot.

[PagerDuty](http://pagerduty.com)
===
"Effictive On-Call Management" Watches all of your systems for problems though e-mail. Expects external monitoring systems to send an e-mail. Specific e-mail address for each system. will actually call your phone. Text-to-voice, press 1 to ignore, press 2 to escalate to "secondary contact" Press 3 to resolve the incident. 

Can create a schedule for who is on call. Will telephone who is on call. Have a secondary rotation. Used if the first person doesn't pick up. 

Looks cool. I want this at work.
