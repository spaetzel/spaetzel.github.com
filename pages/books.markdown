This is a list of books that I wish to read. Over time I've tried a number of online
tools for managing a reading list, I think it'll probably be easier just to manage it here
instead. I do most of my reading on my [Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Wireless-Reader-Wifi-Graphite/dp/B003DZ1Y8Q/?tag=redune-07-20). And yes, most 
of these links are affiliate links.
