title: CastRoller Achievements
---

This is an idea increase the number of people that come back to CastRoller on a regular basis and interact with all of the site's 
features. Basically, I want to implement an "Achivements" system like on the Xbox 360. Basically, users will get points for
doing certain things on the site. When they receive so many points, they can level up and gain new abilities. Other sites that
do this are [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) and [TheSixtyOne](http://thesixtyone.com). 

Ideas for Achivements 
---
- Share 5 episodes
- Add 20 podcasts to your collection
- Invite 5 friends who actually join
- Be the first to share an episode that gets to the "hot episodes"

New abilities
-----
- Categeorize podcasts & channels
- Create featured channels
- Merge podcasts
- Update podcast feed and other details
